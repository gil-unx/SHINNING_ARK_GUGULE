[00000000][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hmm...
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I wonder what's going on.
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I think Panis looks cool like this.
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It may look good, but...
The question is, can we win with this ship?
Also, when a monster appears.
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Even if we strengthen it further,
What should I do specifically?
We can't even figure it out by ourselves.
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][フリード,char_001 Fried]
After all, do you need someone knowledgeable about sea battles?
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Kilmaria, don't you know?
How to fight on a ship.
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Unfortunately, I'm a little...
How about you, Adam?
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
very sorry.
No corresponding program is installed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I don't really understand, but it means no.
I wonder what I should do...
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Then you should hire me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Velvet!? What did you come here for?
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Don't be so angry. It's just a sales pitch.
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Is it a sales pitch? Are you a pirate?
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Yes, that's right. In other words, what you guys are looking for
He's a "naval warfare expert."
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
No sailor knows as much about sea warfare as a pirate.
I don't think so?
At least around this island.
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's why I've never met someone who was my enemy until now.
There's no way I can hire you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Isn't that good?
Depending on the situation, they can be your enemy or your ally.
Just like a ship, leave it to the wind. That's the pirate way.
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
But the enemy that's really bothering you right now is
I don't think he'll ever be on my side.
That's not it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
What do you want to say?
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Did you see it? The other day,
A battle with a huge monster.
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Once again, something like that...
No, if something bigger comes out,
It's a battle like the other day...
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Hmm...
However, even if you are asked to hire someone,
The village doesn't have that kind of money.
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Then don't worry.
What I want isn't money.
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
What do you mean?
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
There's actually something I'm looking for.
Something, or rather... "power".
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
A mysterious power sleeps on this island.
You all know that there are such rumors, right?
What I want is that "power".
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That rumor again?
You seem to believe that.
Is it similar to Bacchus?
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That's not it. I saw it.
A giant that appears with the storm. and chase it away,
A girl with wings...
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Do you mean Mr. Panis?
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
that's right. There is some incredible power on this island.
Isn't it surprising if you're convinced that there is?
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Well, that may be true, but...
But how do you do that?
Are you planning on getting it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][フリード,char_001 Fried]
that's right.
In the first place, about monsters and Panis,
We still don't understand it at all.
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
But someday I'm sure I'll find out the truth.
And also about the source of that power.
In other words, how to use it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
If you figure it out, give it to me.
That's enough reward.
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
If you can accept that,
You can also swear that you won't cause any harm to the village.
I wonder? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
However, even if you say so...
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Anyway, why don't you talk to everyone in the village?
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That's right. Please do that.
Well, let's go to the village.
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][ガルゼー,char_501]
Hire pirates...?
What on earth do you mean?
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][ガルゼー,char_501]
I have attacked this village many times,
Should we trust the pirates who have been causing us trouble?
Don't you think that's a difficult topic?
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][ジム,char_502]
It seems so!I can't trust it at all!
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I guess. I don't think it's a bad thing, do you?
Think about it for a moment? for example……
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Village Chief, I think you should help me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][ガルゼー,char_501]
law?
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What Mr. Velvet said is reasonable.
Pirates are experts at fighting on ships,
Imamura needs that expert.
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][フリード,char_001 Fried]
So, if Velvet-san can help me,
It's very helpful.
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Even Ms. Velvet,
If you promise to give it to me if you find what you want,
They say they won't cause any harm to the village.
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][ジム,char_502]
Do you believe that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I-Is that so? "Do you believe it that easily?"
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Of course I believe you?
But what surprises Velvet is that
Isn't it a bit strange? Hahaha!
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I-I mean, you.
If you suddenly say something like that,
That's usually the first thing you suspect, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][ガルゼー,char_501]
Hmm, I see.
Zinga, Shannon. What do you guys think?
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It's about Freed, after all.
I thought you'd say this anyway.
Well, I don't think what you're saying is wrong.
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I trust Freed's judgment.
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I like Panis and Freed too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][ガルゼー,char_501]
Hehe, I see.
In that case, it's fine.
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][ジム,char_502]
a little bit! Is that okay? That's it!
It's a pirate, a pirate!
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][ガルゼー,char_501]
If something happens, think about it then.
You may start to doubt me now.
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][ガルゼー,char_501]
Freed makes everything easy
Although they seem to accept it,
That's a pretty accurate judgment.
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][ガルゼー,char_501]
It would be so? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
...That's right.
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][ガルゼー,char_501]
So, trust Freed's judgment.
So far, I've never had a problem with it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][ジム,char_502]
...! that's enough!
But I don't know what will happen!
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][ガルゼー,char_501]
Hey, Jim? Oh my gosh, I can't help it.
But I think Jim's concerns are justified.
Please, don't make any strange noises, okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Ha, ha...
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][フリード,char_001 Fried]
good. Velvet-san, thank you for your continued support!
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Is that okay with you guys?
You believe in me too easily!
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Yes, yes! I know!
It's strange for me to say something like that.
You say that, right? It might be weird!
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
But if you ask me,
You guys are weirder!
You're too friendly!
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It took me a while to convince him to hire me,
How to put it into words is
I thought it was a place to show off my skills...
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Without even that, just a word from a completely stupid brother.
It was a quick decision!
unbelievable! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I do not think so……?
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Sigh...this is it...
Why did the village chief and other people...
I wonder if I trust this kind person.
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
But somehow, when it comes to this,
I've become interested in you.
...Hey, wait a minute?　
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I want to know many things about you.
Over there...
Would you like to have a long talk with your sister?
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
a little bit! Get away!　Go over there!
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Why, it's not really attached.
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Still! Generally speaking, you...
------------------------------------------------
[00000083][ロラン,char_507]
Freed! Freed!
Pirates are coming! It's Bacchus's uncle!
------------------------------------------------
[00000084][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Bacchus? Understood! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000085][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Well, I can talk about the details later.
If you are trusted so much by such nice people,
I can't afford not to respond!
------------------------------------------------
[00000086][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Fufufu, what do you think?
You can trust me, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000087][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
As a man, I can't help but feel pain,
Your ability seems certain.
------------------------------------------------
[00000088][ガルゼー,char_501]
If you've protected the village,
It seems safe to trust him.
I look forward to your continued support.
------------------------------------------------
[00000089][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Ufufu, leave it to me.
But please take care of the reward as well, okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000090][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It was something that gave me strength...
I have no idea at the moment...
Let's investigate as much as we can.
------------------------------------------------
[00000091][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Good, good! If you notice something
Please let me know right away. hey?
O・ne・ga・i♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000092][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Ah, ah...
------------------------------------------------
[00000093][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Both the village chief and Freed, yo-ro-shi-ku♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000094][ガルゼー,char_501]
Hmm, hmmm.
------------------------------------------------
[00000095][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
that? I was there just a moment ago.
Freed?
------------------------------------------------
[00000096][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Dakara! Regardless of the old men,
Don't do anything weird to your little brother!
------------------------------------------------
[00000097][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What a strange thing to do. I just
I'm just trying to say hello...
Ah, Freed was there.
------------------------------------------------
[00000098][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000099][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed, Dango! Yes, please!
Eat it! Eat it properly!
------------------------------------------------
[00000100][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, actually eating mud dumplings is
Of course it's impossible.
------------------------------------------------
[00000101][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
So, Freed!
That's not where you're playing!
I'm even criticizing you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000102][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000103][パニス,char_002 Panis]
what happened?
------------------------------------------------
[00000104][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What can I say, Shannon?
It must be difficult for you too. In many ways...
------------------------------------------------
[00000105][アリーゼ,char_504]
Ah~Freed~Shannon~...
That's great~I have something to ask you~...
------------------------------------------------
[00000106][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What what?
------------------------------------------------
[00000107][アリーゼ,char_504]
You know? It's Professor Maia...
It seems that he became unwell and fell asleep...
------------------------------------------------
[00000108][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
picture!
------------------------------------------------
[00000109][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Maia Sensei, are you okay!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000110][アリーゼ,char_504]
Yeah, I guess I'm just tired...
Maia-sensei, it's always difficult...
------------------------------------------------
[00000111][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree. I don't want to make my children anxious,
I've been working hard...
------------------------------------------------
[00000112][アリーゼ,char_504]
That's right...
That's why I want to do something about it...
Is there a better way?
------------------------------------------------
[00000113][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Geez...
To cheer up tired people...
Oh, is that good?
------------------------------------------------
[00000114][パニス,char_002 Panis]
What is that? What?
------------------------------------------------
[00000115][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
“Element of power.” I found that,
To Mr. Maia...
------------------------------------------------
[00000116][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What!? What did you just say!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000117][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
picture? To Mr. Maia...
------------------------------------------------
[00000118][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Source of power! That's what you said after all!
Why, already! It does exist after all!
This village!
------------------------------------------------
[00000119][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000120][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It's okay! Don't cheat!
It's too late now, I heard it already.
------------------------------------------------
[00000121][アリーゼ,char_504]
Eh......
Velvet-san, what happened...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000122][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It seems like you've misunderstood something.
That too is endless. Well, okay.
Let's go get it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000123][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I took a lot,
I'll share it with Velvet.
The essence of power. However……
------------------------------------------------
[00000124][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Is it because you don't know? Later, I said, ``That's a different story!''
Even if you get angry!
------------------------------------------------
[00000125][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That can't happen!
here we go! The source of power!
------------------------------------------------
[00000126][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (I wonder...
Maybe he'll get angry...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000127][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Alright! did it!
Yeah, it's grilled quite nicely.
------------------------------------------------
[00000128][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Um, Freed?
what is that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000129][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It's the source of strength. You picked it up earlier, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000130][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's bread made by kneading that sweet potato into the dough.
Eating this will give you a lot of strength.
------------------------------------------------
[00000131][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
……picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000132][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
In other words, that potato is the "source of power".
This is the bread I'm going to bring to Professor Maia.
------------------------------------------------
[00000133][フリード,char_001 Fried]
If you eat this, you will only get a slight illness.
It will heal in no time.
I'm sure your teacher will get well soon.
------------------------------------------------
[00000134][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000135][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Yes, this. your share.
It's best to eat it while it's still warm.
------------------------------------------------
[00000136][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Ah, thank you...
...! That's not true!
This is not what I want!
------------------------------------------------
[00000137][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I want power!
I seriously need power!
------------------------------------------------
[00000138][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I know that!
But before I explain it, you suddenly say
It wasn't just a quickie.
------------------------------------------------
[00000139][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Gah...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000140][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Well, for today, just bring some bread home.
Have some tea and eat some delicious bread.
It's about calming down.
------------------------------------------------
[00000141][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I don't know why you want something like power, but
If you lean too far forward, things will be bad.
------------------------------------------------
[00000142][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Why do you want power?
Such a thing……
------------------------------------------------
[00000143][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
No, that's fine. Admittedly, I was too impatient.
You're right.
------------------------------------------------
[00000144][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I'll get some bread.
thank you……
------------------------------------------------
[00000145][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Mr. Velvet...
------------------------------------------------
[00000146][パニス,char_002 Panis]
See you soon, Velvet.
------------------------------------------------
[00000147][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
……Yeah. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000148][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It seems like there are a lot of things going on.
Velvet too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000149][アリーゼ,char_504]
Shannon? Is the bread burnt?
I'm going to go to the teacher soon, okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000150][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Ah, that's right. Freed, let's go!
------------------------------------------------
[00000151][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Sensei, is the bread delicious?
------------------------------------------------
[00000152][ロラン,char_507]
Are you feeling better? Are you okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000153][メリー,char_509]
Get well soon, Sensei...
------------------------------------------------
[00000154][マイア,char_503]
Hehehe, thank you. Teacher, it's okay now.
Freed and Shannon
He brought me some delicious bread...
------------------------------------------------
[00000155][マイア,char_503]
Besides, everyone came to visit me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000156][アリーゼ,char_504]
Good!
Teacher, your complexion has improved a lot!
------------------------------------------------
[00000157][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
After all, it's all thanks to that sweet potato.
For the sake of the children,
I need my teacher to get better soon.
------------------------------------------------
[00000158][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Sensei! Let's all play together soon!
Hehehehehe!
------------------------------------------------
[00000159][マイア,char_503]
That's right. My teacher is looking forward to it too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000160][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What are you guys wandering around in peace?
The vigilante group has informed us that pirates have appeared!
------------------------------------------------
[00000161][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000162][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What, that face?
------------------------------------------------
[00000163][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Sorry, you still call other pirates "pirates."
It doesn't feel right.
------------------------------------------------
[00000164][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Does that mean you still don't trust me?
Well...
------------------------------------------------
[00000165][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Zynga, that's rude to Velvet.
------------------------------------------------
[00000166][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
yeah?
------------------------------------------------
[00000167][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
No, that's not what I meant.
But it was bad. Be careful from now on.
------------------------------------------------
[00000168][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Ah, ah...
yes.
------------------------------------------------
[00000169][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
@fcFFAAFFAA (How friendly are these guys!
I'm starting to get worried for some reason...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000170][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
So, who is your opponent?
------------------------------------------------
[00000171][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Looks like Levin.
If it's him, there's no shortage of opponents.
------------------------------------------------
[00000172][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
The ship that I strengthened under my guidance,
I'll show you what you guys are capable of!
------------------------------------------------
[00000173][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis, I'll do my best!
------------------------------------------------
[00000174][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I too will fight alongside you all!
------------------------------------------------
[00000175][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I will try my best to help you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000176][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Yeah, that's how it is!
------------------------------------------------
[00000177][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Understood! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000178][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
there was! Everyone, hurry up and set sail!
------------------------------------------------
[00000179][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Understood! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000180][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hey there, you guys!
Are we going to do it on the sea today?
------------------------------------------------
[00000181][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Okay, that looks interesting too.
Why don't we meet you on the boat too?
------------------------------------------------
[00000182][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Suffice it to say, I was originally
Are you better at commanding naval battles than you are at land battles?
After all, he is a former naval admiral!
------------------------------------------------
[00000183][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Is it an admiral?
------------------------------------------------
[00000184][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Isn't he a prince?
------------------------------------------------
[00000185][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I don't know about his past, but
If it's true, that's terrible.
You guys, do your best!
------------------------------------------------
[00000186][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Understood!
So as not to disappoint Velvet-san,
I do my best!
------------------------------------------------
[00000187][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Thank you, Velvet!
Thanks to you, I've gotten used to fighting at sea.
------------------------------------------------
[00000188][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That's right. The ship's equipment has also become much easier to use.
We alone cannot make practical reinforcements like this.
I couldn't have done it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000189][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000190][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
If Velvet wasn't here,
The village was in danger.
When I think about that, I can't thank you enough.
------------------------------------------------
[00000191][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hmm...
------------------------------------------------
[00000192][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Velvet-san joined us,
It is very nice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000193][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
...Not you, is that really okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000194][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000195][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It's not "Huh?"
What is it with you?
It's like the bottom has fallen out! He's such a nice guy!
------------------------------------------------
[00000196][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Well, I certainly pitched it myself.
I was hired. I told you to trust me.
Yes, I said so.
------------------------------------------------
[00000197][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
However, I only fought a little and won a few times,
I'm so grateful and grateful!
Whatever it is, it's too much!
------------------------------------------------
[00000198][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
You guys are so nice!
You've been able to protect the village well so far, haven't you!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000199][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Because Velvet-san knows how to fight.
You taught me that.
I thought it was natural to be grateful, but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000200][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yeah. I think so too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000201][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
So, you went, right?
What I'm going to help you with is
For the reward!
------------------------------------------------
[00000202][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
find what i want,
I'm here to help you with that!
I understand, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000203][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Of course I understand that.
However, to the person who did a good job,
Isn't it natural to feel grateful?
------------------------------------------------
[00000204][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
...Well, I'd be happy if you could thank me.
That's what you guys are like,
It's not that I don't like it at all...
------------------------------------------------
[00000205][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
But you know! I'm not just a nice guy!
There are some bad guys who will bite you if you show them an opening!
------------------------------------------------
[00000206][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
If it stays like that forever,
I'm sure you'll end up in pain soon!
Even if that happens, I won't help you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000207][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
In the current situation, there is no need to be overly cautious.
I don't think so.
------------------------------------------------
[00000208][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
that's right.
What have you been saying just now?
------------------------------------------------
[00000209][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I don't know!　It's just that I'm so irritated!
Looking at you guys!
------------------------------------------------
[00000210][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That's okay. Anyway, I'm going home today!
See you tomorrow!
------------------------------------------------
[00000211][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000212][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Velvet, what happened...?
He was angry, but he also looked a little sad...
------------------------------------------------
[00000213][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Looks sad... huh?
That's right. Maybe it's sad.
Or maybe it hurts. Somewhere in my heart.
------------------------------------------------
[00000214][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
picture……?
------------------------------------------------
[00000215][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Does it hurt?
Velvet, are you okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000216][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
...Maybe it'll be okay.
Those who have a broken heart realize the pain,
It's finally starting to heal.
------------------------------------------------
[00000217][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
His wounds are starting to close,
Maybe...
I don't know what kind of injury it is.
------------------------------------------------
[00000218][パニス,char_002 Panis]
...Panis, I don't know.
------------------------------------------------
[00000219][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Hehe, well, that's fine with Panis.
Now, let's take everyone back to the village.
------------------------------------------------
[00000220][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
A wound in my heart...
------------------------------------------------
[00000221][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hey, you guys.
This time, I'll ask you to help me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000222][フリード,char_001 Fried]
cooperation? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000223][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Exploring the ruins. According to what I heard from the village chief,
It seems like there are clues left in the north of the island.
Apparently there are ruins.
------------------------------------------------
[00000224][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I see, it's a ruin!
that's nice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000225][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
What is exploration?
------------------------------------------------
[00000226][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Allows you to freely manipulate power
Search for “something”!
It's already decided.
------------------------------------------------
[00000227][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
So, do you know the location?
------------------------------------------------
[00000228][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Yeah. This is a map created based on that information.
------------------------------------------------
[00000229][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
HM. As expected, up to that point,
I've never been there either.
------------------------------------------------
[00000230][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It's an unexplored region where no one is left.
Doesn't it seem like there's something going on?
So, you'll go, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000231][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
ah. Freed, okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000232][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah, I think it's good.
If Velvet-san wants to help me,
Any amount.
------------------------------------------------
[00000233][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hehehe, but if you cooperate,
I also said things like, “The people are so nice!”
I started getting angry.
------------------------------------------------
[00000234][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Shannon!　
At that time, I was just a little irritated.
It's okay, I won't say it again.
------------------------------------------------
[00000235][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Instead, give me what you want
To the child who found it...
I wonder if I can provide some kind of service.
------------------------------------------------
[00000236][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hey, wait!
What are you talking about!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000237][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hahaha! It's got to be a joke!
Give it back, give it back!
Well then, let's go.
------------------------------------------------
[00000238][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
As always, he's someone whose personality I can't grasp.
------------------------------------------------
[00000239][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
You're pretty good too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000240][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Thank you everyone for your hard work.
Now, let's head back to the ruins from the other day.
------------------------------------------------
[00000241][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Seriously, why are you doing this all the time...
I should have kept going instead of turning back the other day.
That way, I wouldn't have to go through the trouble twice.
------------------------------------------------
[00000242][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Now, without further ado,
They should all have frozen to death.
In the end, they would not have been able to reach the ruins.
------------------------------------------------
[00000243][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Certainly, that cold weather is no ordinary thing.
How can I get to the ruins?
------------------------------------------------
[00000244][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
It would be impossible to go there normally.
------------------------------------------------
[00000245][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Impossible!? If so, why bother?
They gathered us together!
------------------------------------------------
[00000246][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
calm down please. With this, you can reach the ruins even in light clothing!
------------------------------------------------
[00000247][パニス,char_002 Panis]
What is that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000248][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
An amulet that grants you the protection of the spirit of fire.
If you have this, you can walk on ice fields without any problem!
------------------------------------------------
[00000249][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Moi! Moimoi!
------------------------------------------------
[00000250][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Kourinmaru seems to be reacting to strong spiritual power.
------------------------------------------------
[00000251][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Ahaha!　You're my friend! Good for you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000252][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What. Get it out quickly!
------------------------------------------------
[00000253][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Even though I was told that, I never expected to use it.
I didn't think so,
It took me a while to find it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000254][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That's why you're here and there
You trip and fall!
Please organize your own luggage!
------------------------------------------------
[00000255][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Ah, uh, uh, I'm sorry...
------------------------------------------------
[00000256][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That's okay. Rather than that, it is now a ruin!
here we go! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000257][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Looks like the monster is gone.
------------------------------------------------
[00000258][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000259][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hmm, it doesn't seem that safe, does it?
Look around?
------------------------------------------------
[00000260][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It's quite a large stone statue.
And a stone monument? What's wrong with this?
------------------------------------------------
[00000261][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Try to remember what happened so far.
If Panis touches a stone statue like this...
------------------------------------------------
[00000262][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I see.
It shook a lot, and then that monster...
------------------------------------------------
[00000263][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
There is no reason to believe that this will be the case, but
There is a need to be cautious.
------------------------------------------------
[00000264][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis, don't do anything!
------------------------------------------------
[00000265][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I know. Freed. Don't take your eyes off Panis, okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000266][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Understood.
------------------------------------------------
[00000267][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Aside from the Panis incident,
What about Killmaria and Velvet?
------------------------------------------------
[00000268][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I see...this might be...
provides a new perspective,
This may be a valuable description.
------------------------------------------------
[00000269][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
However, it seems vague.
Something that can be checked against
I wish I could find historical materials...
------------------------------------------------
[00000270][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
There's something interesting about Kilmaria.
Looks like you've found something to investigate.
However, Velvet...
------------------------------------------------
[00000271][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What, it's completely...!
Even though we worked so hard to get here,
There's nothing!
------------------------------------------------
[00000272][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
It looks like we couldn't find what you were looking for.
------------------------------------------------
[00000273][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Well, I don't think it's clear what you're looking for.
Because of the situation. If you say it can't be helped, it can't be helped.
------------------------------------------------
[00000274][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis, will you help Velvet?
------------------------------------------------
[00000275][フリード,char_001 Fried]
a!  No good!
Stay still!
------------------------------------------------
[00000276][パニス,char_002 Panis]
picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000277][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Ahhh!
Stone statue! I touched a stone statue!
------------------------------------------------
[00000278][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Is this... coming?
------------------------------------------------
[00000279][フリード,char_001 Fried]
what about……
------------------------------------------------
[00000280][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
came!
------------------------------------------------
[00000281][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
W-what!? What is it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000282][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Too!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000283][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Part of the wall is collapsing!
------------------------------------------------
[00000284][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I know! I have to run away quickly!
------------------------------------------------
[00000285][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis!　Here!
------------------------------------------------
[00000286][パニス,char_002 Panis]
No!
------------------------------------------------
[00000287][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
a!That mural!
------------------------------------------------
[00000288][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Kill Maria! Where are you going!
------------------------------------------------
[00000289][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
It's a mural! A mural appears under the collapsed wall!
Is that...a human with wings!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000290][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Let's do it again next time!
It's dangerous now!
------------------------------------------------
[00000291][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yes...
------------------------------------------------
[00000292][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Look! I'll hurry out!
------------------------------------------------
[00000293][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
lie……! Is it this big!?
If you look at it up close, it's completely different!
------------------------------------------------
[00000294][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hey, hey, what should we do!?
How do you fight something like that!? Can you win!?
Hey!
------------------------------------------------
[00000295][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
What's wrong? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000296][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What are you doing...
Anyone would panic if they saw something like that up close!
------------------------------------------------
[00000297][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
is that so……
Hmm...
------------------------------------------------
[00000298][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Even when I saw it for the first time,
I didn't really panic, though.
------------------------------------------------
[00000299][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
You are special! It's not helpful!
------------------------------------------------
[00000300][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
This is not the time to talk!
They're aiming at us!
------------------------------------------------
[00000301][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Velvet-san, if you're scared, hide!
We'll do something!
------------------------------------------------
[00000302][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It would be scarier if I was hiding alone!
I can't help it! I'll do it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000303][パニス,char_002 Panis]
velvet! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000304][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
You will never change, no matter what...
------------------------------------------------
[00000305][パニス,char_002 Panis]
a……
song……
------------------------------------------------
[00000306][パニス,char_002 Panis]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000 I heard it again...
This time, it's a song like this...
------------------------------------------------
[00000307][パニス,char_002 Panis]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000 Ruins, right?
Should I sing there again?
Understood……
------------------------------------------------
[00000308][パニス,char_002 Panis]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000That...
It's not just songs.
I started to see something...
------------------------------------------------
[00000309][パニス,char_002 Panis]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000 Eh... What is this...
no……!
------------------------------------------------
[00000310][パニス,char_002 Panis]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000A lot of houses...are falling apart.
The trees...the forest...are on fire.
No, no, this is happening. I'm scared……
------------------------------------------------
[00000311][パニス,char_002 Panis]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000 No, no, no, no...
Scary, scary, scary, scary, scary...!
It's scary! Freed...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000312][パニス,char_002 Panis]
...Ha!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000313][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis, are you okay?
I lost consciousness again...
------------------------------------------------
[00000314][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed...
------------------------------------------------
[00000315][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I was surprised.
Because I suddenly lose consciousness...
------------------------------------------------
[00000316][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Fu, Freed...
------------------------------------------------
[00000317][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What's wrong, Panis?
I don't feel well.
------------------------------------------------
[00000318][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Your complexion doesn't look good either...
Are you feeling unwell?
------------------------------------------------
[00000319][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Uh, uh...
Panis, it's nothing...
------------------------------------------------
[00000320][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hey, Freed...
older sister……
------------------------------------------------
[00000321][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What?
------------------------------------------------
[00000322][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Take the ruins with you...
The shining crystal...
------------------------------------------------
[00000323][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What is this picture...
A person with wings like Panis...
------------------------------------------------
[00000324][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
However, it seems that both wings are aligned
You can see it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000325][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It shows a very large city.
Is there a city that big on the continent?
------------------------------------------------
[00000326][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
No, I've never seen it.
I've never even heard of the rumors...
------------------------------------------------
[00000327][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Another scenery is shown.
This time, you're crossing a rough sea by boat?
I wonder where I'm going from here...
------------------------------------------------
[00000328][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Hmm...
Maybe, just maybe, this is...
------------------------------------------------
[00000329][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Kill Maria, have you learned anything?
------------------------------------------------
[00000330][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
No, that's what I understand.
This could be...
But, but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000331][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What's up?
------------------------------------------------
[00000332][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Hmm...I'm sorry, but...
Could you please leave me alone for a while?
There's something I'd like to take a closer look at.
------------------------------------------------
[00000333][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture?Well then, Panis, let's go.
------------------------------------------------
[00000334][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah……
------------------------------------------------
[00000335][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
everyone! Let's go!
------------------------------------------------
[00000336][フリード,char_001 Fried]
eh!?
Hey Kilmaria, calm down!
------------------------------------------------
[00000337][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
that's right. When you go out, where exactly are you going?
------------------------------------------------
[00000338][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Ah, ah, sorry. Me,
I was completely panicked and just...
What should I do...
------------------------------------------------
[00000339][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Okay, calm down. Please speak in order.
------------------------------------------------
[00000340][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yes, yes. Well, to the ruins beyond the ice field,
I would like you to come with me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000341][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I don't mind that, but what are you going to do?
------------------------------------------------
[00000342][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Is there something I should investigate?
------------------------------------------------
[00000343][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yes, at that time, I caught a glimpse of the mural.
I'm really curious.
If I could see that again...
------------------------------------------------
[00000344][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Ah, now that I think about it, at that time,
You said something.
------------------------------------------------
[00000345][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yes, that's it!
I'd like to investigate that properly.
Could you please accompany me?
------------------------------------------------
[00000346][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
While investigating the ruins of the village,
I feel like I'm starting to understand something.
I get the impression that it's still a deciding factor...
------------------------------------------------
[00000347][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Once again, the ruins on the other side of the ice field,
Check out that mural
I feel like I understand something.
------------------------------------------------
[00000348][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Understood. Mr. Kilmaria, I'll ask you for the amulet again.
------------------------------------------------
[00000349][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
yes!
------------------------------------------------
[00000350][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
wonderful!got it! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000351][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Moi? Moi!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000352][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hey, Freed. Kilmaria is
Why are you making such a loud noise?
------------------------------------------------
[00000353][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It seems like you understand something.
What did I find out?
------------------------------------------------
[00000354][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Come on. At most, as you can understand
I hope you can explain...
------------------------------------------------
[00000355][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Anyway, let's listen.
Mr. Kilmaria, what did you find out?
------------------------------------------------
[00000356][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
yes! Perhaps I,
We may have uncovered the origin of this island!
------------------------------------------------
[00000357][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Besides, maybe
Also about the true identity of Mr. Panis!
------------------------------------------------
[00000358][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Do you want panis?
------------------------------------------------
[00000359][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What do you mean?
Can you tell me more details?
------------------------------------------------
[00000360][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Of course.
Now, let me explain step by step.
------------------------------------------------
[00000361][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Why am I?
If you want to come to this ruins,
I came here the other day and when I ran away due to the earthquake...
------------------------------------------------
[00000362][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I was curious about the mural I saw.
That mural has wings like Mr. Panis.
The figure of a humanoid creature that is not a bird person was drawn.
------------------------------------------------
[00000363][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Like what I saw in the ruins of the village the other day?
------------------------------------------------
[00000364][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
that's right. Although many descriptions of these winged people remain,
Everything is vague...
------------------------------------------------
[00000365][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
There was a lack of decisive factors in grasping the actual situation.
However, that video I saw at the ruins the other day...
And here's the mural...
------------------------------------------------
[00000366][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
The two are
In my head as I investigated the ruins of the village.
It connected perfectly!
------------------------------------------------
[00000367][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's why you came here to check out the murals, right?
What was that mural?
------------------------------------------------
[00000368][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yes, that mural was placed right next to it.
Something that supplements the description on the stone tablets,
It was like an illustration, so to speak.
------------------------------------------------
[00000369][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
And the contents of the stone tablet are:
Characteristics of winged people and their civilization
It was detailed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000370][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Furthermore, there are other stone monuments deep inside the ruins.
This one is in poor condition...
------------------------------------------------
[00000371][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
The winged people are on the brink of destruction,
There is a description that indicates that he fled to this island.
I was able to decipher it somehow.
------------------------------------------------
[00000372][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
in? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000373][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Do you know about ancient civilizations?
------------------------------------------------
[00000374][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I know.
If I remember correctly... I think I said something like Enfield Civilization.
A civilization with far superior technology than now...
------------------------------------------------
[00000375][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Treasures found all over the world
Most of them are substitutes made in that era.
------------------------------------------------
[00000376][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Enfield...
There is data that partially matches that phrase, but
Most are damaged.
------------------------------------------------
[00000377][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Well, you've been left alone since that era.
I guess that's what happened.
Your memory will also be distorted.
------------------------------------------------
[00000378][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
If we're talking about the Enfield civilization,
We followed Dr. Maia's example.
------------------------------------------------
[00000379][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It became extinct 1000 years ago,
We still don't know the reason, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000380][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
that's right. It's helpful to talk quickly.
So, here's my hypothesis...
------------------------------------------------
[00000381][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
A winged person is
They are the people who built that ancient civilization.
Is it not?
------------------------------------------------
[00000382][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
What!? Well then, Panis...
Are they descendants of ancient civilizations?
------------------------------------------------
[00000383][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Huh!? What? what is that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000384][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Moi!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000385][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
home. There is also the possibility that they are ancient civilized people themselves.
In fact, I think that's more likely.
------------------------------------------------
[00000386][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What is that?
If that's true, then that's an amazing discovery!
But why are such important records on this island?
------------------------------------------------
[00000387][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
That's another hypothesis.
In my opinion, this island...
------------------------------------------------
[00000388][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Created by ancient people for the survival of their tribe,
Isn't it an "ark" so to speak?
------------------------------------------------
[00000389][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hako...bune?
------------------------------------------------
[00000390][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
In other words, when the ancient people faced extinction,
Created to preserve biological species, including humans, for future generations.
It's a place of refuge.
------------------------------------------------
[00000391][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
This island!? Is that so!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000392][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
This is just a hypothesis. But if you think about it
There are many records in the scattered ruins.
What is left behind, and...
------------------------------------------------
[00000393][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
There are also artifacts left behind from advanced civilizations.
I think you can understand it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000394][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
A product of advanced civilization...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000395][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yeah. It is assumed that it was created.
------------------------------------------------
[00000396][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
...I have no memory of it,
I don't think it's impossible.
------------------------------------------------
[00000397][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I understand the story, but even if they say it's an ancient civilization...
you don't say? I can't believe Panis is that old.
------------------------------------------------
[00000398][パニス,char_002 Panis]
About a long time ago...?
Have you seen Panis? A long time ago.
------------------------------------------------
[00000399][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000400][パニス,char_002 Panis]
The other day, after the big boy disappeared,
I saw it once upon a time.
------------------------------------------------
[00000401][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is the big boy that monster?
It's true that Panis lost her consciousness after defeating her...
------------------------------------------------
[00000402][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Did you see it at that time?
But how did you know it was so long ago?
------------------------------------------------
[00000403][パニス,char_002 Panis]
do not know. It was a long time ago...
------------------------------------------------
[00000404][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Many houses were destroyed,
A lot of trees are on fire...
------------------------------------------------
[00000405][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Does that mean that ancient memories have come back to life?
Moreover, what about the time of destruction...!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000406][フリード,char_001 Fried]
So, what Kilmaria-san is saying?
It's the truth……!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000407][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I see...crops grow abnormally on this island,
The creatures that live there are also all unique.
Is that also due to something called "seed conservation"?
------------------------------------------------
[00000408][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
A heritage of ancient civilization...! I see!
The true nature of the “power” that is said to be sleeping on this island is
That was it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000409][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
My decision after looking at this is,
I wasn't wrong!
------------------------------------------------
[00000410][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
However, in the current theory,
There are still some things I can't fully explain...
------------------------------------------------
[00000411][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
For example, Mr. Panis was sleeping on the continent,
Something to do with the monsters attacking the island...
------------------------------------------------
[00000412][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Yeah, about Panis.
There are many things I want to know.
The same goes for the stone statue I mentioned earlier.
------------------------------------------------
[00000413][フリード,char_001 Fried]
As soon as he touched the stone statue, an earthquake occurred,
Then a monster appeared.
I can't believe that... I wonder if they're aiming for Panis...
------------------------------------------------
[00000414][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
If so, you're in trouble!
In order to protect Panis, we must solve the mystery quickly!
------------------------------------------------
[00000415][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Mugyu!　
Big sister, it's cool...
------------------------------------------------
[00000416][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
In any case, it's all just a hypothesis.
We still have to continue the verification work...
------------------------------------------------
[00000417][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Hehehehe, it's still for a while.
Looks like the busy days will continue...!
------------------------------------------------
