[00000000][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Where are those ruins?
Please guide me soon!
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Well, don't panic.
First, let's take a look at the group of monsters blocking that road.
I have to do something.
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It's a hassle to take a detour.
Should I just put it away in one go?
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's true too.
Alright, everyone let's go!
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Ou!
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Please finish it quickly.
I have to hurry to the ruins.
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...Mr. Kilmaria,
It seems like they have no intention of fighting together.
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Is it me?
Not like that!
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Fighting alongside people who may be the devil's followers, etc.
This is a consultation that cannot be done!
That is against justice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Good grief.
There is a limit to being stubborn.
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It can't be helped, sister.
Defeat them quickly and move on!
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Phew, I managed to sort it out.
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
It looks like the battle is over.
Now, let's go to the ruins as soon as possible!
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Good grief.
He's such an impatient person...
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed, look! over there!
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, a monster?
Especially at times like this...
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][メリー,char_509]
Wow!
Monsters are scary!
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][ロラン,char_507]
Okay, I'll take care of it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hey! We'll get rid of the monsters,
Everyone is hiding in this rocky area. Understood?
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][メリー,char_509]
Gusu...I understand...
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I'll defeat you soon and come back.
Everyone, be a good boy and wait for me!
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Shannon is right!
Leave the rest to us!
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Okay, now that's all cleared up.
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][ロラン,char_507]
Oh! I really beat them all!
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][メリー,char_509]
Freed, so cool!
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Ah!? Here! Has everyone come out?
I told you to hide properly.
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][カール,char_508]
Because, where Freed and his friends fight,
I really wanted to see it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][メリー,char_509]
Freed was so cool!
You look like a different person than usual!
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Thank you very much.
But maybe that's something to be happy about...
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][パニス,char_002 Panis]
That's not true.
Freed is always cool.
Hey?
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis...
thank you. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Ehehe...
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hey there, Freed.
Don't get carried away just because you're popular with kids.
Let's finish some errands quickly.
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][フリード,char_001 Fried]
This is the first time I've heard of Katamefuto cotton.
Where is it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
If you walk through the forest, you'll find it easily.
You can easily tell them apart because they are fluffy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][パニス,char_002 Panis]
a! It's so fluffy!
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Yes, that is Katamefuto cotton.
Panis, you found it well.
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Ehehe~.
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Should I harvest it and take it home?
But there are monsters roaming around.
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Disturbing monsters are
I guess I'll just have to clean it up.
There is no way to detour.
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I guess it can't be helped...
Understood. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Okay, the monster is gone.
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Now there are no more obstacles.
You can collect Katamefuto cotton with peace of mind.
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yay!
Fluffy and fluffy!
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Panis, you didn't come here to play.
Dad is waiting.
Let's get it quickly and go home.
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][フリード,char_001 Fried]
To think we'll have to fight on a ship...
It's different from usual.
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I wonder if I can really fight with this.
What about Zynga?
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
To be honest, I don't know.
But we have no choice but to do it, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree. Everyone, let's go!
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hey, what are you delaying?
Shoot more flashily!
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][バッカス,char_527]
Well, even if you say that,
There are many preparations that need to be made before firing a cannon.
Cleaning the soot, filling it with gunpowder...
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Are you telling me to hurry up with that work?
If you wait, instead of a cannonball,
I'm going to load your head!
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Enemy heavy weapons attacks are a threat.
That weapon should be destroyed first.
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Having said that, on this unstable footing,
It can't be helped that it's difficult to do...
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Better yet, how about destroying the ship itself?
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
That strategy works, but it takes too much time.
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Either way, everyone please be careful.
Just avoid a direct hit from that cannon!
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Okay, we've done a lot of damage to the ship!
Somehow I can see the future!
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Don't let your guard down, Freed.
There are still enemies left!
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What are you doing, Gus!
I can't use the cannon anymore!
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][バッカス,char_527]
Oh, I'm sorry...if this happens!
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Confirm the existence of a new large firearm!
It's aimed at us!
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What did you say?
There were still cannons left!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][バッカス,char_527]
You did a great job earlier!
If this happens, I'll blow it to pieces with my main gun!
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Why, if such a convenient thing exists.
Get it out quickly! This trash!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
If you were to be hit directly by such a huge cannon,
There isn't even a single one.
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Everyone, concentrate your attacks on that main gun!
One more breath, let's do our best!
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Did you win...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Looks like it's over somehow.
I'm really tired this time...
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
At one point, I wondered what was going to happen.
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][バッカス,char_527]
Woooooooooo!!
I was just one step away!
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][バッカス,char_527]
Bell, I'm sorry.
I'm sure this guy is worthless...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hmm...
I thought so.
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed, over there!
Jim is here!
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][ジム,char_502]
Hey, hey!
Don't come, don't come here!
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Are you surrounded by monsters?
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed, what should we do?
The gym is going to be tough at this rate!
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, I know.
Jim, I'll help you now!
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Okay, now we've defeated the monster!
Jim, are you hurt?
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][ジム,char_502]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Jim, what's wrong?
Does it hurt somewhere?
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][フリード,char_001 Fried]
There doesn't seem to be any injury, but...
I wonder if I'm dazed from shock.
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Anyway, it's dangerous to stay here.
Let's go back to the village.
Jim, can you stand up?
------------------------------------------------
[00000083][ジム,char_502]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000084][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I can't help it...
Adam, can you carry me?
------------------------------------------------
[00000085][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I got it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000086][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It really does save me a lot of time...
------------------------------------------------
[00000087][フリード,char_001 Fried]
In order to strengthen the ship, we need a large amount of materials.
Let's quickly collect them and go home!
------------------------------------------------
[00000088][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Wait, Freed.
Before that happens, we have to do something about that monster.
------------------------------------------------
[00000089][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Watching out for monsters while chopping down trees
It's a very difficult task.
It seems better to take care of them first.
------------------------------------------------
[00000090][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Understood! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000091][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Okay, we managed to get rid of the monster.
------------------------------------------------
[00000092][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Ah, that's right.
All that remains is to gather materials and transport them to the village.
------------------------------------------------
[00000093][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Ah... that's right.
There was still work to be done...
------------------------------------------------
[00000094][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What are you going to do if you forget your original purpose?
------------------------------------------------
[00000095][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed, let's do our best together.
I'll help you with Panis, okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000096][フリード,char_001 Fried]
……I agree. Okay, let's do our best to collect materials!
------------------------------------------------
[00000097][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Before I knew it, it was already evening.
It's almost time for it to start getting dark.
------------------------------------------------
[00000098][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It's dangerous to explore after dark.
Until then, let's explore as much as possible.
------------------------------------------------
[00000099][フリード,char_001 Fried]
roger that.
...When it comes to Kill Maria-san's story, around here,
There should be an entrance to the ruins.
------------------------------------------------
[00000100][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But there are monsters roaming around,
I can't take my time exploring it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000101][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I can't help it.
Defeat the monsters before continuing your exploration!
------------------------------------------------
[00000102][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Looks like this is the last monster.
Now I can continue exploring.
------------------------------------------------
[00000103][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But the sun is already setting.
If you don't find it soon, it'll get dark.
------------------------------------------------
[00000104][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
There is a hollow in the rocky area ahead.
There seems to be a large space in the back.
------------------------------------------------
[00000105][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture?Adam, where is the cavity?
------------------------------------------------
[00000106][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
It's right there, straight ahead.
------------------------------------------------
[00000107][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That’s it!
It was dark and I couldn't see much.
------------------------------------------------
[00000108][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
But it's weird.
If it's bright out, you'll probably notice it right away.
------------------------------------------------
[00000109][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
...I see, I see.
------------------------------------------------
[00000110][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture?
Zynga, did you find out something?
------------------------------------------------
[00000111][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Moss will grow on this rock.
Draw a horizontal line on the rock wall.
------------------------------------------------
[00000112][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
At high tide, up to this line
It means the tide is coming in.
The tide is low now, so it's at this height.
------------------------------------------------
[00000113][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Really!
What Kilmaria explored was
It was at high tide!
------------------------------------------------
[00000114][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That means,
If it's not this time every day,
The entrance to the ruins cannot be found.
------------------------------------------------
[00000115][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That's what it is.
I don't have time today.
Let's explore again tomorrow with Kilmaria.
------------------------------------------------
[00000116][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Mr. Panis, please step away a little!
From now on, that ignorant person,
I'll give you the hammer of Justice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000117][パニス,char_002 Panis]
No.
------------------------------------------------
[00000118][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000119][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That woman doesn't seem like an ordinary person.
Freed, be careful.
------------------------------------------------
[00000120][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, I know.
No matter who the other person is,
I won't let you kill Panis!
------------------------------------------------
[00000121][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Are you interrupting me?
I can't help it. I'll deal with you all together...
------------------------------------------------
[00000122][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
What do you think, Viola-san?
This is the power of Justice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000123][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Damn... no...
But... I can't just ignore it like this...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000124][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (This person...
Why do you look so sad...? )
------------------------------------------------
[00000125][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Jinga, do you think you can go?
------------------------------------------------
[00000126][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
ah.
It may not be possible to do it so skillfully...
It's okay somehow.
------------------------------------------------
[00000127][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I'm going with all my heart!
To that unholy sea devil
I'll give you my condolences for Justice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000128][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Enemy body, closest!
Coming towards us!
------------------------------------------------
[00000129][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Looks like they're full of motivation.
I can't back down now.
------------------------------------------------
[00000130][フリード,char_001 Fried]
In the end, we have no choice but to fight...!
Understood! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000131][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Wow! ...Kehokeho.
Ugh, I drank seawater...
------------------------------------------------
[00000132][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is everyone safe!?
Calm down and get back on track!
------------------------------------------------
[00000133][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Hmm...
After all, naval battles are different...
------------------------------------------------
[00000134][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Someone who knows how to fight on a ship,
I wish you were here...
------------------------------------------------
[00000135][フリード,char_001 Fried]
There's no point in lamenting the lack of military strength.
What we can do at this moment
Let's do our best!
------------------------------------------------
[00000136][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Did it disappear...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000137][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Confirm the disappearance of enemy bodies.
It's our victory.
------------------------------------------------
[00000138][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I see...we won...
------------------------------------------------
[00000139][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
ah. This guy is just too happy to let go.
------------------------------------------------
[00000140][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I think you can see our weaknesses.
I'm really not good at fighting on ships...
------------------------------------------------
