[00000000][ガルゼー,char_501]
…………
I can not believe that……
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][リアン,char_514]
Panis, is that true?
Something is wrong, or my memory is wrong...
Isn't that what it means?
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][パニス,char_002 Panis]
No, it's not a mistake or a misremembering...
I came from another world 1000 years ago...
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][パニス,char_002 Panis]
And the civilization that flourished in this world,
I destroyed it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][ジム,char_502]
So now you have come to destroy the village!?
You were the one who called that monster too!
Shit, I thought it was weird from the beginning!
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][パニス,char_002 Panis]
wrong! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][ジム,char_502]
Whether you intend to or not,
You did the same thing! What was that the other day?
After turning the village into a mess...
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][ジム,char_502]
I even made Maia-sensei hurt me!
Poor teacher, he lost consciousness.
Don't wake up yet!
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][パニス,char_002 Panis]
The teacher...
Like that...
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][ジム,char_502]
No, wait a minute?
I was only concerned about the village, but...
There's a bigger problem.
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][ハンス,char_510]
what's that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][ジム,char_502]
Panis once 1000 years ago
He's destroying the world.
That means this time too, let alone the village...
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][ジム,char_502]
Aren't you trying to destroy the world?
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][パニス,char_002 Panis]
That's not the case!
I'm just trying to save my world...
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][ジム,char_502]
For that purpose, this world
They were trying to invade!
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Such an invasion!
I just...
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Ah...but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][ジム,char_502]
Look! You can't argue!
I guess that's what you want!
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][パニス,char_002 Panis]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][パニス,char_002 Panis]
sorry……
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis...
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed...
Goodbye……
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis...
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Too...
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][ジム,char_502]
Go, go! When I returned to the village...
I can't guarantee your life!
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][フリード,char_001 Fried]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Freed, what's wrong?
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][フリード,char_001 Fried]
nothing.
Just a thought...
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Are you talking about panis?
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][フリード,char_001 Fried]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Don't think about that kid anymore.
Panis is for the village, no...
He is dangerous to the world.
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That kid knows that too.
So he disappeared from our sight.
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][フリード,char_001 Fried]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
And because of Panis, the village is falling apart.
Jim and the others are strangely murderous,
Adam has also become strange since then.
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Killmaria is holed up in the ruins without eating,
Velvet also suddenly disappeared somewhere.
Shannon would still be depressed, wouldn't she?
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah……
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
If you were only thinking about Panis at a time like this,
Everyone gets really weird.
Listen, forget about that kid.
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I forget too... That child has become an enemy of the village.
Even if it's hard or sad,
That's the only thing we can do.
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Do you understand? Freed...
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][フリード,char_001 Fried]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Well then, I'll go.
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What on earth should I do...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Attack target, discovered.
Signs of an attack, the same thing was discovered.
Continuing to search for enemies...
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][フリード,char_001 Fried]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I understand what Jinga is trying to say.
Panis actually turned the village into a mess.
Besides, in the past, the world...
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But does that mean panis is dangerous?
I can't think of Panis as an enemy...
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis...what do you think...?
Are you now... where is she...?
Answer me... Panis...
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][フリード,char_001 Fried]
The sea is quiet...
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][フリード,char_001 Fried]
The village is already in pieces;
Even though there's nothing I can do...
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Why only the sea?
It must be so spacious and quiet.
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Even if the sea is rough,
Someday it will be quiet like this...
Will the time come when the village returns to normal?
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Even though I was thinking about this...
I know it can't be helped.
If I don't do something...
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But what should I do...
I don't really understand...
... Do you understand Kourinmaru?
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Yes...
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][フリード,char_001 Fried]
After all, for the sake of the village,
No, for the sake of the world...
Is Panis something that shouldn't exist?
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][フリード,char_001 Fried]
If that's the case, why don't you take the panis with my hands...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed?
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed...
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis...
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No!
I have to kill Panis...!
You can't do that!
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Always cheerful and kind to everyone,
And you can work hard for others.
Kill such Panis...? I am not joking!
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I want to be with Panis!
About my family, about my village,
Also, the world is important, but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I'm with Panis after all...!
But then the world...
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Ahhh! already!
What should I do!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hey there, boy.
What are you doing here?
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture……? Why is Levin...
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hey. I can't go to the sea, and there's nothing to do.
If this continues, my body will only get worse.
That's why I practice on the beach every day.
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I can't let my proud arms and bayonets get rusty.
Because I can't go.
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's right……
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
in? Did you answer it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, not me...
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hey, are you okay?
You just don't want to talk about it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, that's not the case.
But nothing special...
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hey, it's not clear.
If that's the case, I can't help it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I guess I'll try to find out, even if it's a bit forceful.
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Levin!
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
what? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][フリード,char_001 Fried]
the……
Me...as expected...
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
ah? Don't know what to do?
It doesn't seem like it. That really doesn't seem right, Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][フリード,char_001 Fried]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
...Okay?
I think your strength is your unity.
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Unity...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000083][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Ah, when you all unite and come together,
He is a truly formidable opponent.
I can say that he is the strongest I have ever faced.
------------------------------------------------
[00000084][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But now it's falling apart...
------------------------------------------------
[00000085][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Ah, that's right. It's not like it's organized.
Do you know why?
------------------------------------------------
[00000086][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's... Panis...
------------------------------------------------
[00000087][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
different. What still remains unorganized and disjointed is that
...Freed, it's your fault.
------------------------------------------------
[00000088][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Mine...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000089][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
That's it. It was all centered around you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000090][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
It means that you firmly believe in yourself,
Never wobbles,
Because I have accepted everything that comes my way.
------------------------------------------------
[00000091][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
The core necessary for a group to come together.
That's you, Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000092][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I am...the core...
------------------------------------------------
[00000093][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
However, you are not like that now.
It's wobbling a lot.
------------------------------------------------
[00000094][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Without saying what I think,
I don't even want to hear what the other person thinks.
Why is that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000095][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
It's you, yourself, the other person,
It's because I don't fully believe it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000096][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
No matter what I say, they don't understand,
That distorted reticence that you don't understand even if you ask,
I'm tearing you apart.
------------------------------------------------
[00000097][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Believe in yourself... and in others...
------------------------------------------------
[00000098][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
That's it. If you don't believe, you can't rely on or be relied on.
You can't do it, can you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000099][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Trust me and show your true feelings to the other person.
You could tell me what you wanted, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000100][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Also, accept the other person's true feelings head-on.
I'm not saying you should just wrap your head around it.
If you don't like it, say you don't like it. Collide as many times as you like.
------------------------------------------------
[00000101][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
In this way, we can understand each other's feelings,
When we become one, we are finally born.
This is your great power.
------------------------------------------------
[00000102][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Our great power...
------------------------------------------------
[00000103][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
You can't convey your feelings unless you say them, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000104][ロラン,char_507]
Freed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000105][カール,char_508]
Levin!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000106][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Aw.
------------------------------------------------
[00000107][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Everyone!? Why are you here?
------------------------------------------------
[00000108][メリー,char_509]
You see, Maia-sensei and I came for a walk.
Then Freed and Levin were there!
------------------------------------------------
[00000109][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000110][マイア,char_503]
Mr. Freed, Mr. Levin. Good evening.
------------------------------------------------
[00000111][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
This is a polite greeting, but it hurts.
You are as beautiful as ever.
------------------------------------------------
[00000112][マイア,char_503]
Eh!? Also, already! Oh no!
Mr. Levin!
------------------------------------------------
[00000113][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Teacher!? Is your injury okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000114][マイア,char_503]
Yeah. Sorry for making you worry, okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000115][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No. I'm glad you're feeling better...
------------------------------------------------
[00000116][マイア,char_503]
Hehehe. When my students are having a hard time,
You can't stay at home forever.
------------------------------------------------
[00000117][マイア,char_503]
Actually, I've heard a lot of things.
About Panis-chan.
------------------------------------------------
[00000118][フリード,char_001 Fried]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000119][ロラン,char_507]
Hey hey, Freed!
When will Panis come back?
------------------------------------------------
[00000120][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Huh!? But, Panis...
------------------------------------------------
[00000121][カール,char_508]
Panis, are you coming back?
We can all play together again, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000122][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hey, everyone...
Aren't you all afraid of panis...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000123][ロラン,char_507]
Eh? why? Panis is your friend, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000124][フリード,char_001 Fried]
……picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000125][メリー,char_509]
Somehow, my father and mother...
He said he was scared of Panis.
Adults sometimes say strange things, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000126][メリー,char_509]
But I'm not scared at all, right?
I want to meet Panis soon...
------------------------------------------------
[00000127][フリード,char_001 Fried]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000128][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I see... Panis hasn't changed.
Panis is Panis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000129][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No matter what happened in the past,
The Panis I know now is the Panis I know.
------------------------------------------------
[00000130][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Too! Moimoi!
------------------------------------------------
[00000131][フリード,char_001 Fried]
……that's right! Shannon is Shannon! Everyone is everyone!
Nothing has changed since then!
------------------------------------------------
[00000132][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hahaha!
He's finally starting to look like the boy he always was!
------------------------------------------------
[00000133][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Well, at best I tried my best.
Well then, I'll excuse myself for this.
------------------------------------------------
[00000134][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Thank you, Levin!
Hey, I'll try it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000135][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, you know...Shannon.
Is it okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000136][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
eh!
------------------------------------------------
[00000137][フリード,char_001 Fried]
W-what!? What happened?
I was surprised at how exaggerated it was.
------------------------------------------------
[00000138][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Oh, I'm sorry. However, I also
I want to talk to Freed.
Because that's what I was thinking...
------------------------------------------------
[00000139][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Actually, I've been thinking about it for a while.
About Panis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000140][フリード,char_001 Fried]
My sister too!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000141][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Freed too? what……
Oh I see……
------------------------------------------------
[00000142][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I've been thinking about Panis ever since.
I wanted Freed to ask me too.
I don't know how to cut it out.
------------------------------------------------
[00000143][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Because there's a strange atmosphere in the village,
Freed is also depressed...
------------------------------------------------
[00000144][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
And it's about Panis.
I thought maybe I was the only one worrying about it, but...
It's getting harder and harder to talk...
------------------------------------------------
[00000145][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is that so……
My mind was only thinking about myself...
Sorry I didn't notice...
------------------------------------------------
[00000146][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
No, it's fine.
Freed was worried just like me...
But...listen to me, Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000147][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Panis must have been calling monsters,
Something extraordinary happened a long time ago.
Maybe he did.
------------------------------------------------
[00000148][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
But that child has his own reasons.
I think he did it.
That's why I have to find him and ask him why.
------------------------------------------------
[00000149][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Did your sister think so too?
------------------------------------------------
[00000150][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Freed too?
------------------------------------------------
[00000151][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah. Because panis is panis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000152][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis never does anything weird for no reason.
She's not the kind of girl to do that. I'm sure something
She had a reason to do it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000153][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
……yes!Because, isn't it? Panis...
She's our little sister!
------------------------------------------------
[00000154][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
There's no way he's a bad kid! absolutely!
Freed thought so too, right? As expected of my younger brother!
------------------------------------------------
[00000155][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
If you decide, let's go!
We have to bring our little sister home!
------------------------------------------------
[00000156][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Understood! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000157][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Panis doesn't seem to be around here.
------------------------------------------------
[00000158][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000159][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Are you okay, Panis...
I wonder if he's eating properly...
------------------------------------------------
[00000160][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I wonder if I can sleep somewhere warm at night...
I can't believe I'm shivering from the cold...
------------------------------------------------
[00000161][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Ahhh! No good! I'm starting to worry about Panis!
We need to find him quickly and bring him home!
------------------------------------------------
[00000162][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Shannon, don't worry. Let's take our time to look for it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000163][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
but……
------------------------------------------------
[00000164][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Are you okay. I'm sure I can find Panis.
Then, let's go home together, the three of us.
------------------------------------------------
[00000165][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Until then, never worry,
Don't let it get burnt.
nice? Let's do our best together!
------------------------------------------------
[00000166][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000167][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...That's right.
It's not like you'll find panis if you rush.
Right on. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000168][フリード,char_001 Fried]
oh yeah!
------------------------------------------------
[00000169][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...Haa.
------------------------------------------------
[00000170][フリード,char_001 Fried]
what happened? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000171][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
No. It's just...
I was feeling anxious all by myself,
I feel kind of stupid.
------------------------------------------------
[00000172][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I wish I had consulted Freed sooner.
I thought it was good. That's just what I thought.
------------------------------------------------
[00000173][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree. I think I should have consulted you.
She should have asked me for my thoughts sooner.
------------------------------------------------
[00000174][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Because if you don't talk, nothing will be conveyed.
I don't know anything. and……
Nothing will start.
------------------------------------------------
[00000175][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's right. Really.
But it's not too late now.
------------------------------------------------
[00000176][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Meet and talk to as many people as possible!
Let's collide our thoughts and the thoughts of the other person!
That's the most important thing we can do right now!
------------------------------------------------
[00000177][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000178][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Velvet-san, I want you to listen to me.
Also, I would like to hear your thoughts, Velvet.
------------------------------------------------
[00000179][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I also want you to lend me your wisdom.
……Is it okay? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000180][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I don't mind though...
What? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000181][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's...
It's about Panis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000182][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Ah... I see, I guess that's what it is...
Well, we certainly need to talk.
------------------------------------------------
[00000183][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Me too, about that child.
I can't leave it like this
That's what I was thinking.
------------------------------------------------
[00000184][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Being alone outside the village...
I wonder if that kid knows how dangerous it is...
------------------------------------------------
[00000185][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Mr. Velvet...
------------------------------------------------
[00000186][フリード,char_001 Fried]
……thank you.
Thank you for worrying about Panis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000187][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
picture? There's also my situation.
------------------------------------------------
[00000188][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
After all, the clue to the "power" that lies on this island is...
I'm sure that kid is holding it.
I have to ask!
------------------------------------------------
[00000189][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
For that purpose, I have to find that child!
------------------------------------------------
[00000190][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...Hehe.
As for Velvet...
------------------------------------------------
[00000191][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Oh, um...well, that's okay.
Anyway, me
There's something about that kid that bothers me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000192][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What kind of thing?
------------------------------------------------
[00000193][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What did that child do?
I understand what you mean, but
Why did you do that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000194][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What kind of circumstances were going on in that child's world?
I don't really understand that part yet.
------------------------------------------------
[00000195][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It's just that the village was destroyed.
It feels like everyone is getting hotter and hotter.
------------------------------------------------
[00000196][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
But then what really happened?
What is about to happen is
You don't understand, do you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000197][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
At times like this, it's best to listen to both sides.
Then I'm sure I'll finally understand something.
------------------------------------------------
[00000198][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Well, the result is something I didn't want to know.
Maybe I'll understand...
------------------------------------------------
[00000199][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's not true!
Panis is definitely not a bad thing...
------------------------------------------------
[00000200][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That's your point, Shannon.
That's no different from the people in the village.
Anyway, first of all, let's listen to Panis' story.
------------------------------------------------
[00000201][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
For that reason, I would like to take that child as soon as possible.
I have to find it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000202][フリード,char_001 Fried]
After all, that's where it comes from.
Panis, where on earth are you...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000203][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I hope you're okay, but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000204][ピーター,char_520]
Freed! "You were here!"
It's hard! Bacchus has arrived!
------------------------------------------------
[00000205][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Bacchus?　Wow, that Tonchiki.
I really can't read the atmosphere...
------------------------------------------------
[00000206][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But I can't just leave it alone.
First, we have to get rid of Bacchus!
------------------------------------------------
[00000207][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
...Huh.
Hehehehe...
------------------------------------------------
[00000208][フリード,char_001 Fried]
what happened? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000209][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
No, isn't it strange?
I never expected Bacchus to say something like that to me!
Hehehe...
------------------------------------------------
[00000210][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree. In some ways, the usual us
Because he's the one I know best.
------------------------------------------------
[00000211][フリード,char_001 Fried]
From the perspective of Bacchus,
There's definitely something wrong with us right now.
------------------------------------------------
[00000212][フリード,char_001 Fried]
And it's not just us,
I'm sure the whole village is like that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000213][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I want to go back soon. In the village as usual.
And...to us.
------------------------------------------------
[00000214][フリード,char_001 Fried]
To do that, I have to find Panis.
With Panis and then with everyone...
We have to have a good talk.
------------------------------------------------
[00000215][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Otherwise, nothing will move.
First of all, we have to start from there...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000216][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hehe...
Freed is starting to look like himself.
------------------------------------------------
[00000217][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's right.
He's very reliable...as usual Freed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000218][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, I guess...
Anyway, let's do our best!
I need to find Panis quickly!
------------------------------------------------
[00000219][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Mr. Kilmaria.
------------------------------------------------
[00000220][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000221][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Kill Maria! How about I just reply?
------------------------------------------------
[00000222][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000223][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yay!
Hey, everyone!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000224][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What happened!?
Did you scream or something?
------------------------------------------------
[00000225][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I-I'm sorry for what I did.
I had no idea you would be here.
Because it's something I didn't expect.
------------------------------------------------
[00000226][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Anyway, I'll bring you some tea now.
please wait a moment……
------------------------------------------------
[00000227][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Oops……
------------------------------------------------
[00000228][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Don't worry...
Or rather, Mr. Kilmaria.
Should I sit down?
------------------------------------------------
[00000229][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
that's right. Also, weren't you doing some research without sleeping?
------------------------------------------------
[00000230][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
No, it's okay. I got some sleep in the morning.
------------------------------------------------
[00000231][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That won't happen in my sleep!
Why so much...
------------------------------------------------
[00000232][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
For Justice, of course!
------------------------------------------------
[00000233][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Justice again?　
What on earth is going on with Justice this time?
------------------------------------------------
[00000234][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
It's all about you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000235][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Us? What do you mean?
------------------------------------------------
[00000236][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
He suddenly comes and “exorcises” Mr. Panis out of the blue.
I started saying such disturbing things,
Everyone accepted me as a friend.
------------------------------------------------
[00000237][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
it is really amazing,
They are full of justice,
That's what I always thought.
------------------------------------------------
[00000238][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
However, all of them are now separated.
On the contrary, it is a touch-and-go situation...
------------------------------------------------
[00000239][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
This should not be done!
This is totally against Justice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000240][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
But that...
------------------------------------------------
[00000241][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yeah. About Mr. Panis,
This is the cause of the rift between you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000242][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
But Mr. Panis, and
A clue to bring you all together again
It may be in the ruins.
------------------------------------------------
[00000243][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Mr. Panis, who was suspected to be the devil,
The fact that he was able to obtain material to conclude that this was not the case,
After all, it was the ruins of this island.
------------------------------------------------
[00000244][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
However, in the end, Mr. Panis
He was also an entity that ``took revenge'' on the world.
I learned this from the ruins...
------------------------------------------------
[00000245][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Still, Mr. Panis is no devil.
I believe this judgment is justice.
If so, evidence of that should be found in the ruins!
------------------------------------------------
[00000246][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
And you can find it by
Probably just me...
I have to be of help to you all!
------------------------------------------------
[00000247][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Thinking so, I secluded myself in the ruins.
I was looking into anything that might be a clue.
------------------------------------------------
[00000248][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I see.
So what were you looking into?
------------------------------------------------
[00000249][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
It's an inscription I found earlier that I can't decipher.
I made a stone-print copy of that,
I was trying to decipher it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000250][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Can you do that!?
Is this a word you've never seen before?
------------------------------------------------
[00000251][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
It's difficult, but there are many ways.
for example……
------------------------------------------------
[00000252][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It's going to be long so I'll leave the explanation for later.
Did you read it or not?
Can you talk about that first?
------------------------------------------------
[00000253][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yes, yes. In conclusion,
I was able to read it to some extent.
------------------------------------------------
[00000254][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What was written there?
------------------------------------------------
[00000255][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
That's it, apparently.
That stone monument is probably a winged person...
People who seem to be of the same family as Mr. Panis...
------------------------------------------------
[00000256][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
attacked our world,
It was about a crisis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000257][フリード,char_001 Fried]
The world of Panis?
What on earth happened!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000258][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
yes. A stone monument that describes the details of the crisis is
Found at another site.
------------------------------------------------
[00000259][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I haven't made a copy of that yet, so
Let's talk on the spot.
Everyone, please follow me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000260][フリード,char_001 Fried]
This is the world of Panis
Is it a stone monument with writing on it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000261][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I haven't been able to decipher the details yet, but
Based on what we know now, I would guess that
The world in which Mr. Panis and his friends lived was back then...
------------------------------------------------
[00000262][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Attacked by some terrifying "enemy",
It seems that it was on the verge of extinction.
------------------------------------------------
[00000263][フリード,char_001 Fried]
The world of Panis...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000264][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
So Panis, in order to escape from the enemy,
Did he come to this world?
------------------------------------------------
[00000265][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Probably. Or first set up
The ``Ark'' hypothesis is
Maybe it's connected here.
------------------------------------------------
[00000266][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
People in another world facing destruction,
At least to try to preserve the species,
Put Mr. Panis and others on the ship...
------------------------------------------------
[00000267][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...I let him escape into this world.
But then there was a conflict with the ancients...
------------------------------------------------
[00000268][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Ancient civilizations and people on ships,
They all perished.
Leaving only Panis...
------------------------------------------------
[00000269][フリード,char_001 Fried]
If so, how much is panis?
I must have felt sad.
And even now...
------------------------------------------------
[00000270][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
But wait?
A conflict between ancient people and people from other worlds...or rather,
To be honest, a war broke out...
------------------------------------------------
[00000271][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Are you saying that aliens tried to invade this world?
------------------------------------------------
[00000272][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That’s it…!
------------------------------------------------
[00000273][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Maybe the ancients tried to eliminate the people from another world.
I don't know, and I don't know the details.
------------------------------------------------
[00000274][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That's right...
Oh, speaking of what I don't understand, let's talk about that monster.
------------------------------------------------
[00000275][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It was said that Panis called it in from somewhere.
It's been talked about...
Where are you actually calling from?
------------------------------------------------
[00000276][フリード,char_001 Fried]
From the world of Panis, isn't it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000277][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
But I came here to save another world,
And it failed 1000 years ago, right?
Does that mean the other world is already destroyed?
------------------------------------------------
[00000278][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Ah, I see.
So, I guess they're calling from somewhere else.
...Where does it come from?
------------------------------------------------
[00000279][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
There's no way I would know.
Well, let's leave this matter for later.
There are still things I don't understand.
------------------------------------------------
[00000280][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
If the other world is already destroyed,
Why is Panis so desperate?
------------------------------------------------
[00000281][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
If there's no more world to protect,
If only I could give up and live here quietly.
Isn't it great? ...Although it's a sad story.
------------------------------------------------
[00000282][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's right...
------------------------------------------------
[00000283][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Anyway, the more I think about it,
I feel like there are more and more things I don't understand.
I'm going to die.
------------------------------------------------
[00000284][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
……I agree.
As Velvet said,
There are many things I don't understand. but……
------------------------------------------------
[00000285][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Apparently, Mr. Panis now has a memory.
It seems like it's coming back,
It might be faster to ask Mr. Panis...
------------------------------------------------
[00000286][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That's true after all.
That's what it is...
------------------------------------------------
[00000287][フリード,char_001 Fried]
After all, I have to find Panis soon...
------------------------------------------------
[00000288][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Panis is gone,
It's been quite a while...
------------------------------------------------
[00000289][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree……
------------------------------------------------
[00000290][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Where on earth is he?...
worry……
------------------------------------------------
[00000291][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That's right...
Besides, I want to hear the details from Panis as soon as possible...
------------------------------------------------
[00000292][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
...!?
what? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000293][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
No way, this is...
------------------------------------------------
[00000294][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
It seems like no way!
There's a red moon in the sky!
------------------------------------------------
[00000295][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What did you say!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000296][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Panis!
------------------------------------------------
[00000297][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed...! everyone……!
------------------------------------------------
[00000298][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis!
Don't hang out with monsters!
Come back here!
------------------------------------------------
[00000299][パニス,char_002 Panis]
is it wrong!
This child is not a monster!
This child is the scream of my world...
------------------------------------------------
[00000300][フリード,char_001 Fried]
A scream from the world of Panis?
Then maybe...
------------------------------------------------
[00000301][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Panis, come back!
Don't be in a place like that!
------------------------------------------------
[00000302][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Please, please come here!
At this rate, we
We'll have to fight!
------------------------------------------------
[00000303][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Big sister... Kill Maria...
That's what fighting is all about...
But... me...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000304][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That's not good...
If this continues, monsters will come to the island.
I have to do something……!
------------------------------------------------
[00000305][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Damn...
After all, I have no choice but to fight him...
------------------------------------------------
[00000306][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I agree.
I think that's the only way to protect the village.
------------------------------------------------
[00000307][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
But what to do?
Zynga and Adam aren't there?
Can you move the ship?
------------------------------------------------
[00000308][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Am I the only one who knows about ships?
I have no choice but to try somehow...
------------------------------------------------
[00000309][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hey, Bell. Don't overdo it.
No matter how you look at it, you don't have enough hands, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000310][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Levin!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000311][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What is it, you!?
What did you come all this way for?
------------------------------------------------
[00000312][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
There's no such thing as "what".
You came all the way to help me, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000313][フリード,char_001 Fried]
really?
Will you become our friend?
------------------------------------------------
[00000314][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
You too, finally.
You woke up to Justice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000315][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Oops, don't get me wrong, okay?
Friends, Justice,
I'm not interested in that kind of thing.
------------------------------------------------
[00000316][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
This island I want to make my territory,
I don't want to be destroyed by such a monster. That's it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000317][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
In other words, it's just a temporary truce.
Only to conclude a temporary alliance.
That's how I want to be understood.
------------------------------------------------
[00000318][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Why, those words suddenly came to me...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000319][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
In short, I have no intention of getting to know you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000320][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
You're such a troublesome guy, you too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000321][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What the hell!
If you can help me, it would be a big help!
Nice to meet you, Levin!
------------------------------------------------
[00000322][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hehe, leave it to me!
------------------------------------------------
[00000323][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I'm sorry, but I'm sure you have your own circumstances...
------------------------------------------------
[00000324][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed...!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000325][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But, me too.
I had to protect my village and my friends.
I'm really sorry...
------------------------------------------------
[00000326][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed...
------------------------------------------------
[00000327][パニス,char_002 Panis]
...Unantari Batrisa Muia
------------------------------------------------
[00000328][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000329][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Zuiukut Tovheime
Toyzuco Bi Freed
------------------------------------------------
[00000330][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis? As of now...
------------------------------------------------
[00000331][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I asked this child.
"I'm sorry, but please go home now."
------------------------------------------------
[00000332][パニス,char_002 Panis]
``With Freed and the others,
There's something I need to talk to you about.''
------------------------------------------------
[00000333][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Really……
------------------------------------------------
[00000334][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
So? If you say "I have something to say",
Of course you'll let me know, right?
About your circumstances.
------------------------------------------------
[00000335][パニス,char_002 Panis]
yes……
I'll tell you everything...
------------------------------------------------
[00000336][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Mr. Panis' world was attacked by a powerful enemy.
It was written on the inscription,
Isn't that wrong?
------------------------------------------------
[00000337][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I don't know if I should call them enemies, but
Indeed, my world is
He was under great threat...
------------------------------------------------
[00000338][パニス,char_002 Panis]
No, I am being exposed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000339][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
"is"? But isn't that a story from 1000 years ago?
------------------------------------------------
[00000340][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I didn't know that either.
This world of Endias and me,
It seems like time passes differently.
------------------------------------------------
[00000341][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Therefore, even though 1000 years have passed here,
There are still a few years left over there...
------------------------------------------------
[00000342][パニス,char_002 Panis]
However, in those few years, the world over there,
I was always on the brink of extinction.
------------------------------------------------
[00000343][パニス,char_002 Panis]
The giants and monsters that attacked your village,
The “will to seek salvation” of the people living in my world
What has materialized...
------------------------------------------------
[00000344][パニス,char_002 Panis]
So to speak, the screams of people, the cries of pain,
These things were moving and had shapes.
Looking for "someone" to help me...
------------------------------------------------
[00000345][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I see. "A world where strong thoughts take shape"
Because that's what I've been told.
------------------------------------------------
[00000346][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That kind of thing...
But what makes the people of this other world scream,
What kind of "threat" is this?
------------------------------------------------
[00000347][パニス,char_002 Panis]
"The Titan of the End"...
------------------------------------------------
[00000348][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
...Apocalyptic...giant?
------------------------------------------------
[00000349][パニス,char_002 Panis]
A giant who is said to herald the end of the world.
He is so big and strong that he swallows everything.
He is a terrifying being that no weapon can penetrate.
------------------------------------------------
[00000350][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What is that? If something like that comes out,
The world really isn't the end!
------------------------------------------------
[00000351][パニス,char_002 Panis]
yes. Slowly, gradually,
It is being destroyed by the titans of the end.
------------------------------------------------
[00000352][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
So, the girls came here because
Out of reach of that giant,
Is it to acquire new territory?
------------------------------------------------
[00000353][パニス,char_002 Panis]
home. It was to ask for help.
------------------------------------------------
[00000354][パニス,char_002 Panis]
The people of my world who are evacuating,
I want you to accept it. Even if it's just a little bit.
At worst, it's just the people who came on the ship.
------------------------------------------------
[00000355][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
After all, it was "Ark"...
However, it is not an ancient civilization;
Another world...
------------------------------------------------
[00000356][パニス,char_002 Panis]
But it didn't go well.
The people of this world, we are here.
I wonder if it will bring in the giant of the end...
------------------------------------------------
[00000357][パニス,char_002 Panis]
It seems that I had such doubts,
She had a hard time accepting it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000358][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's it! terrible!
------------------------------------------------
[00000359][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Having said that, accepting refugees is...
It's not easy, is it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000360][パニス,char_002 Panis]
yes. We were also at fault.
------------------------------------------------
[00000361][パニス,char_002 Panis]
For a long time, facing the anxiety and fear of extinction,
We who have lived...
------------------------------------------------
[00000362][パニス,char_002 Panis]
something that is terribly frightened of everything it sees and hears
Everything feels like a sign of doom.
I was pushed to such a point.
------------------------------------------------
[00000363][パニス,char_002 Panis]
So, regarding these people,
I couldn't believe it with all my heart.
Somewhere along the line, I couldn't hide my doubts.
------------------------------------------------
[00000364][パニス,char_002 Panis]
In such a situation, both
There's no way the negotiations will go well...
------------------------------------------------
[00000365][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Certainly, with someone who doesn't believe in me
It's a difficult thing to talk about...
------------------------------------------------
[00000366][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I'm going to talk to everyone in the village right now.
It's tough...
------------------------------------------------
[00000367][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
So what happened?
------------------------------------------------
[00000368][パニス,char_002 Panis]
... Meanwhile, they actively accepted us,
People have appeared who are willing to help.
I thought this would save us. but……
------------------------------------------------
[00000369][フリード,char_001 Fried]
but?
------------------------------------------------
[00000370][パニス,char_002 Panis]
These people were truly terrifying.
These people's goals are what they want
To create "new life"...
------------------------------------------------
[00000371][パニス,char_002 Panis]
The idea was to use us as experimental subjects...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000372][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What did you say!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000373][パニス,char_002 Panis]
These people have already lost even their own compatriots.
Many of them were thrown away as experimental tables.
So, we who came from another world...
------------------------------------------------
[00000374][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I only thought of it as a cool material.
------------------------------------------------
[00000375][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
terrible……! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000376][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
...No way...
------------------------------------------------
[00000377][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
what happened? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000378][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
In the ancient civilization period and now, the races living in this world
There is a theory that they look completely different
There is...
------------------------------------------------
[00000379][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
No, let's stop it. If you think too much,
As expected, I feel sick to my stomach.
------------------------------------------------
[00000380][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
So, what happened to Panis and the others...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000381][パニス,char_002 Panis]
From there, it was like rolling down a hill.
Everything went in the wrong direction.
------------------------------------------------
[00000382][パニス,char_002 Panis]
The friends who were on the ship
Growing anger and distrust towards the people of this world,
That causes a backlash from the other party...
------------------------------------------------
[00000383][パニス,char_002 Panis]
What is the path to gradually and peacefully resolving the situation?
It became closed.
And we were in despair...
------------------------------------------------
[00000384][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Does that mean a war has started...
Of course, that's what the other party had in mind, too.
The war is rapidly expanding...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000385][パニス,char_002 Panis]
yes. Many of my friends died.
Our ship was gradually forced to retreat offshore...
------------------------------------------------
[00000386][パニス,char_002 Panis]
In the end, they suffered heavy losses,
I ended up making an emergency landing on this island.
Enfield's army approaches there...
------------------------------------------------
[00000387][パニス,char_002 Panis]
The few remaining companions were also wiped out.
And my heart was dominated by anger and sadness...
I……
------------------------------------------------
[00000388][パニス,char_002 Panis]
...Oh my god!　Ah...oh my god!
------------------------------------------------
[00000389][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis, calm down.
What happened at that time?
------------------------------------------------
[00000390][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Ah, Freed...
I did something very scary...
I've done something that can never be forgiven!
------------------------------------------------
[00000391][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What is not allowed...?
What on earth is that...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000392][パニス,char_002 Panis]
As you know, my songs have a mysterious power.
But when I leave my world,
There was a song I was told never to sing.
------------------------------------------------
[00000393][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Once that song is sung, it will change the face of the world,
It could cause irreparable destruction.
It was said...
------------------------------------------------
[00000394][パニス,char_002 Panis]
And the one who sang gave his life
It will burn everything down and even lead to death...
------------------------------------------------
[00000395][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I leave that “forbidden song” to my anger and sadness,
I ended up singing in the center of Endias...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000396][パニス,char_002 Panis]
As I heard,
I used up all my strength...
I poured everything into this taboo song.
------------------------------------------------
[00000397][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Luckily, my life was saved, but...
Instead, it lost one of its wings.
The remaining one was also black and small like this.
------------------------------------------------
[00000398][パニス,char_002 Panis]
And then I passed out...
What happened after that...I don't know anything.
At least until I came to this island...
------------------------------------------------
[00000399][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I heard something amazing...
As expected, I have no words either...
------------------------------------------------
[00000400][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
But the story isn't over yet.
There isn't one, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000401][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
A girl's world is
She is still threatened by the "Doomsday Titan".
Is that so?
------------------------------------------------
[00000402][パニス,char_002 Panis]
yes……
------------------------------------------------
[00000403][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...I understand the situation.
So what do you want Panis to do?
------------------------------------------------
[00000404][パニス,char_002 Panis]
it is……
------------------------------------------------
[00000405][パニス,char_002 Panis]
...I hurt Maia-sensei,
I, who did something terrible to the village,
I know it's too selfish to say this.
------------------------------------------------
[00000406][パニス,char_002 Panis]
But I want to save the world I was born into.
Family and friends who live there...
I want to save everyone...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000407][パニス,char_002 Panis]
But that...
It's so impossible for me alone...
Without your help...
------------------------------------------------
[00000408][パニス,char_002 Panis]
...Please, Freed!
Lend me your strength!
Let's save my world together!
------------------------------------------------
[00000409][フリード,char_001 Fried]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000410][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Okay, Panis.
Leave it to us!
------------------------------------------------
[00000411][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000412][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hey, hey, Freed!
What are you answering right away!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000413][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
that's right! How on earth can you save it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000414][フリード,char_001 Fried]
The giant of the end, the monster that first attacked the village,
Both are giants. We are from that giant
I saved the village. It'll work out somehow!
------------------------------------------------
[00000415][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Don't be so reckless!
------------------------------------------------
[00000416][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Please calm down and think!
The titan of the end will destroy the entire world.
He's the kind of person who could put you in danger!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000417][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Still do it!
With people from the world of Panis...
Besides, maybe the people of this world too...
------------------------------------------------
[00000418][フリード,char_001 Fried]
The lives of people living in two worlds,
It's up to us!
Moreover, we might be the only ones who can save them!
------------------------------------------------
[00000419][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That's why!
There are things you can do and things you can't do!
------------------------------------------------
[00000420][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Even I know it's difficult.
But to give up without even trying...
I definitely don't want that! in addition……
------------------------------------------------
[00000421][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis believes in us,
I'm glad she asked for help.
I want to respond to that!
------------------------------------------------
[00000422][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
believe in us...
I see...that's right!
Freed is right!
------------------------------------------------
[00000423][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Let's do it!
I'll live up to Panis' trust!
------------------------------------------------
[00000424][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Yes! Moimoi!
------------------------------------------------
[00000425][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Fufu...fufufufu...
It's starting to get interesting, isn't it?
Boy, I'll be with you for a while too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000426][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Looking at other worlds,
It might be useful for my own country building.
------------------------------------------------
[00000427][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Oh my... these guys are still...
Kill Maria? what will you do?
I can't compete with Freed like this, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000428][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
……I agree.
What Mr. Freed says is the most just.
Maybe it will come true.
------------------------------------------------
[00000429][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
From a while ago, my Justice
I'm whispering!
Be with your friends and lend a hand to Mr. Panis!
------------------------------------------------
[00000430][パニス,char_002 Panis]
everyone……
------------------------------------------------
[00000431][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis, we're not the only ones.
I'm sure Zynga and Adam too.
Besides, I'm sure everyone in the village will lend a hand.
------------------------------------------------
[00000432][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's not proof... but...
this……
------------------------------------------------
[00000433][パニス,char_002 Panis]
this is……?
------------------------------------------------
[00000434][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I got it from the children in the village.
Please give it to Panis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000435][パニス,char_002 Panis]
everyone is……?
------------------------------------------------
[00000436][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah. And... Mr. Maia too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000437][パニス,char_002 Panis]
picture……!
Teacher Maia...
About me...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000438][パニス,char_002 Panis]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000439][パニス,char_002 Panis]
The teacher... everyone...
About me like this...!
Gusssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss...
------------------------------------------------
[00000440][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis, don't cry.
If I go back to the village, I can meet my teacher right away.
------------------------------------------------
[00000441][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Gussu... That's right... I want to meet you, teacher.
When we met, the first thing I said was that I had hurt you.
I want to apologize...
------------------------------------------------
[00000442][パニス,char_002 Panis]
...Freed. Let's go back to the village.
I have to go back and tell everyone.
What I've done so far...
------------------------------------------------
[00000443][パニス,char_002 Panis]
And how I feel now...!
------------------------------------------------
