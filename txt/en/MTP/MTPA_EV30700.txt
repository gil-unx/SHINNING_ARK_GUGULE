Sigh...
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][ダニエル,char_518]
troubled……
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What happened to both of you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][ダニエル,char_518]
Oh, Freed?
In fact, animals have been injured because of Panis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][ダニエル,char_518]
I have to go find some medicine.
Both my son and I are very busy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Understood. Wait a minute!
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][ピーター,char_520]
Thank you for finding medicinal herbs.
The animals are also very happy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][ダニエル,char_518]
Definitely, Panis guy.
You did something stupid...
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's the thing...Peter...
You remember how Panis loved the animals, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][ピーター,char_520]
picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That panis is
Would you hurt an animal for no reason?
What do you think?
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][ピーター,char_520]
That may not be the case though...
But he's actually injured...
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Deciding that Panis is a bad guy is
Do it after listening to what Panis has to say.
Can I have it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][ピーター,char_520]
but……
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][ダニエル,char_518]
what? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][ピーター,char_520]
Maybe you're reacting to Freed's story?
...Now that I think about it, Panis...
You took good care of these children...
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][ピーター,char_520]
The song that Panis will listen to,
I loved these kids...
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][ダニエル,char_518]
HM……
got it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][ダニエル,char_518]
Understood.
Let's think about Panis for a moment.
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][ピーター,char_520]
I agree. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][フリード,char_001 Fried]
thank you!
I'm sure Panis will love it too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][ボリス,char_511]
It hurts...
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][フリード,char_001 Fried]
what happened?
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][ボリス,char_511]
Oh, Freed. Sorry.
No, my back hasn't been feeling well lately. It hurts...
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][ボリス,char_511]
Panis-chan always brings medicinal herbs.
He brought it for me,
I never expected that kid to do something like that...
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's... no, I'll talk about that later.
Wait a minute.
I'll pick up some medicinal herbs.
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Thank you for waiting. I picked some medicinal herbs.
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][ボリス,char_511]
Oh, sorry.
I think this will make things a lot easier.
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][ボリス,char_511]
But that Panis-chan
I had no idea she was that kind of girl...
I still can't believe it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's what it is...
Panis is always for Boris, who has a bad back.
You brought me some medicinal herbs, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][ボリス,char_511]
Ah, that's right. If you are a kind child,
That's what I thought...
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][フリード,char_001 Fried]
How could such a kind child suddenly do such a thing?
Isn't it weird? There's something going on with Panis.
I guess there was...
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][ボリス,char_511]
nothing……
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I've always thought that way.
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][ボリス,char_511]
...I guess so.
Freed, you might be right.
Indeed, that Panis-chan...
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][ボリス,char_511]
What is this?
Maybe there was...
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][ジム,char_502]
Isn't he here?
Look over there!
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Gym? All the vigilantes are here too, did something happen?
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][ジム,char_502]
The children are gone!
If you have free time, look for it too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][フリード,char_001 Fried]
The children...?
That's tough! I'll look over there!
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][ジム,char_502]
Freed! What happened to the children?
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][フリード,char_001 Fried]
All the vigilantes took him back to the village.
I feel safe now.
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Those kids, for Panis
I was out picking flowers.
Look at this...
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Because Panis is my favorite flower,
He said he would give it to me when he got back...
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][ジム,char_502]
Those guys...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hey, Jim. Panis is just like us,
You were working hard for everyone in the village, weren't you?
A friend from the village, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Those kids knew it best.
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][ジム,char_502]
That's why!　
Are you going to protect someone who would destroy the world? You are!
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Gym. Something happened.
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Just like Jim wants to help everyone in the village,
Panis also wanted to help people in her hometown.
The result was something like this...
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But Panis' feelings,
Could you please give it some thought?
I'm begging you……
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][ジム,char_502]
...Uh, how noisy!
I'm not thinking about anything either.
Because it's not true!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][ジム,char_502]
Oh, by the way, I like panis as much as I like.
Even though it was a hard hit...
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Gym……
thank you……
------------------------------------------------
