[00000000][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...It was quite a walk from the entrance.
Is there still a way to go?
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed, look!
It's brighter in the front.
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is true.
It looks like the ceiling is collapsing ahead.
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
This is...a ruin!
There are ruins deep inside this cave!
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
There are also monsters.
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Kilmaria-san, you want to investigate those ruins, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yes, of course!
But before that, there's a monster in the way.
Let's eliminate it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is this the last time?
Looks like the monster is gone.
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Hey, look.
There's a hole over there.
This cave seems to continue for a long time.
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Everyone, please wait!
The first thing to do is to investigate this ruin!
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Okay, let's quickly collect them.
I'd like to say...but...
Monsters are in the way.
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
If monsters are wandering around,
I can't calm down and cut my hair.
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That's right.
Well then, I guess I'll chase them away.
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
The monster that was roaming around here
I guess it's mostly cleaned up.
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah, it doesn't look like he's coming back any time soon.
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Well then, right now,
Let's collect the hair of the giant horned mojara and go home.
her mother is waiting
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][フリード,char_001 Fried]
This is where I turned back the other day.
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
that's right.
I haven't been able to investigate beyond this point.
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
There's another monster.
I wonder where it comes from?
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
By not defeating monsters,
I don't think I can go this far.
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Okay. Everyone, let's take care of the monsters!
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Okay, the monster is gone.
Now let's move forward.
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
This is uncharted territory.
Everyone, let's be very careful.
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Kill Maria-san is the most dangerous,
Be careful, really...
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It's kind of creepy...
Something seems like it's about to come out.
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Don't say anything nasty.
Panis will be scared.
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But it's definitely creepy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
A plane of unknown affiliation ahead!
It's coming this way!
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What did you say!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][？？？,char_601]
Found an intruder.
Intercept mode starts.
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
That is……!
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
We have confirmed the identification code of the unknown aircraft.
Combat Orgaroid,
The type is "Cherubim Queen E.V.E."
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Adam, do you know him?
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
That...I don't know.
Detailed memory is missing.
but……
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Now is not the time to say that!
It's coming!
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][ケルビム,char_529]
Interception mode has started.
Eliminate intruders.
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
damn it!
That guy is strong!
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That sturdiness is troublesome...
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hey Adam!
Doesn't he have any weaknesses?
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
As for me...I don't know.
Information is missing.
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Anyway, until he shuts up
Don't keep hitting me!
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][ケルビム,char_529]
Interception mode continues.
Eliminate intruders.
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][ケルビム,char_529]
Shi...intruder...annihilation...
Senme...tsu...
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][ケルビム,char_529]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is it finished...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It looks like it's stopped moving.
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
We did it, everyone!
Another big victory for Justice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It was it! Mr. Hans! Are you okay?
Firmly!
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][ハンス,char_510]
oh……
Freed? No, it's a shame...
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Don't talk now!
Anyway, I'll take you back to the village!
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Well...to take Hans home.
Maybe the monsters wandering around are a nuisance.
I have to take care of this first!
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Okay, there's no more trouble.
Hans, can you walk?
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][ハンス,char_510]
Oh, oh.
If you support me, somehow...
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Understood. Watch your step.
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Wow...this is terrible.
It really feels like a desolate land.
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hans, you came back alive and well.
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I wonder where the oasis Hans-san was talking about?
There is something like a dry pond...
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
please look!
There are what appear to be ruins around the dried up pond!
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is true.
That's different from what Hans said.
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Let's find out right away!
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Kilmaria-san, wait!
Before that, I have to get rid of the monsters that are in my way!
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Phew, it looks like it's cleared up.
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
There's no one in the way anymore, right?
Let's start the investigation right away!
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Kill Maria is gone...
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][フリード,char_001 Fried]
As usual, it's progressing at a rapid pace...
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][フリード,char_001 Fried]
This is the last job.
Let's all do our best!
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
There are monsters roaming around.
Shall I clean it up first?
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's safer that way. Let's chase it away!
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Okay, the monsters are mostly taken care of.
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Let's quickly heal Soncho's bath!
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree.
Collect a lot and make it into something great!
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Why are you targeting Panis?
There must be some reason!?
Maybe it's because Panis is an ancient person?
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
"Ancient people"...?
Are you saying that you know what I mean?
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
...No, you don't need to know.
Just shut up and watch.
If you get in my way...I won't show any mercy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
What do you mean!?
Are you saying that winged humans and ancient humans are unrelated?
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Unrelated?　That can't be true.
That's why I came to kill you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What on earth are you talking about?
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][フリード,char_001 Fried]
So, Panis is an ancient person!?
Maybe you are
Does it have something to do with those who targeted the “Ark”?
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
"Ark"? ...If that's what you want to think, that's up to you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Another incomprehensible thing!
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
The Ark, the Ancients, and Panis...
I don't understand it at all!
------------------------------------------------
[00000083][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
nevertheless! I'll protect my friends!
------------------------------------------------
[00000084][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Even if you resist, I will definitely kill you.
Because that's my mission.
------------------------------------------------
[00000085][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Damn...! If this goes on……
------------------------------------------------
[00000086][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Any further fighting is pointless.
I recommend surrender.
------------------------------------------------
[00000087][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
I won't give up.
As many times as I want...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000088][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Next time, I'll do whatever it takes...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000089][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Did it disappear again?
------------------------------------------------
[00000090][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But I was able to protect Panis...
It was a dangerous place...
------------------------------------------------
[00000091][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I'm here again...!
It's a monster!
------------------------------------------------
[00000092][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
already!
Because Velvet says some weird things!
------------------------------------------------
[00000093][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It’s my fault!?
Wait a minute, that's...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000094][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
This is not the time to say things like that!
It's coming!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000095][]
……help me.
