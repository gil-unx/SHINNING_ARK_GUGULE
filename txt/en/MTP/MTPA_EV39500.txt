[00000000][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Moi! Mo~imoi!
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hmm, uh...
Hey, can you say more?
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Moi! Mo~imoi!
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis, what are you doing?
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][パニス,char_002 Panis]
You know, Panis, please give this child some good words.
I'm being taught something.
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Are you trying to remember Kourinmaru's words?
I think that would be... very difficult.
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][パニス,char_002 Panis]
That's not true!
Panis, you can do it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hey, can you say more?
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Moi! Mo~imoi!
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Um, um...I understand!
I'm saying "I'm hungry"!
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][パニス,char_002 Panis]
The bento that my sister made for me,
I'll share it with you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Yes...
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][フリード,char_001 Fried]
He's eating, but he doesn't seem very happy.
Panis, isn't it different?
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][パニス,char_002 Panis]
It's no different!
Yes, you can eat more!
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Yes!　Moi~!
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I'm saying "More! More!"
Freed, let's give you more food!
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Moimoi~!
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][フリード,char_001 Fried]
My lunch box is gone too.
Panis, after all, Kourinmaru is
Maybe you're saying something different?
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Moi! Moi-moi-moi!
Moi moi, moi moi!
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][パニス,char_002 Panis]
``It seems like it's making my stomach swell.''
Ask your sister to share the bread with you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What?
Did you call me?
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Ah, sister!
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Moi, moi, moi, moi!
Moi moi moi!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Oh, wait!
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I ran so fast...
Shannon, what did Kourinkomaru say?
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
``I've been gaining weight lately, so...
I said I didn't need it! ” Because.
What on earth is that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][パニス,char_002 Panis]
………………that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (I gave in to temptation and ate all of Kourinmaru too.
I wonder...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed, look!
The person in this picture looks like Zinga!
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Ah, the beastman mural.
Is true. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Zynga looks big and strong!
Well, do you have a picture of your sister?
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (For Panis, ancient murals are also
It's just a caricature.)
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (But... more than that...
The profile of Panis illuminated by the moonlight,
It's so...beautiful)
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed, what's wrong?
Do you need something for Panis?
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What!? Um, that...
I thought, Wow, that's beautiful.
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yes, it's really beautiful!
The woman in this picture,
You're beautiful just like your sister!
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, that's not it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Ah, vague words are no good!
To express your feelings to Panis,
It has to be a more straightforward word...! )
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Pa, Panis!
Oh, about me, Panis...
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Ah!
Freed, look! That picture!
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Huh!? What!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Look, that picture!
The person in that picture looks exactly like Freed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, me?
That mural of a warrior with a pig-like face,
Looks just like me...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah!
Looks strong like Freed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's right...
thank you……
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (... Panis seems to have complimented me,
I guess that's okay...yeah...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][フリード,char_001 Fried]
that? What are you doing here?
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][ドルトン,char_506]
Freed, you've come to the right place.
Let me hear your opinion as well.
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][ラナ,char_528]
The sculptures and statues in the ruins around here,
Don't you think it has an interesting shape?
I think it would sell well if I made a model.
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][パニス,char_002 Panis]
What is mokei?
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][ドルトン,char_506]
That's right... well, it's like a doll.
The statue here is reproduced exactly like the real thing,
It's a small doll.
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][パニス,char_002 Panis]
A doll? Wow wow!
I want panis too! I want to play with it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][ラナ,char_528]
It's a little different from a toy doll, though.
It's like a decoration for your room or something like that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hey, isn't that okay?
...So, what do you mean you want to hear my opinion?
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][ラナ,char_528]
That's because of the material.
Naturally, I was looking for a small wooden model.
That's what I intended.
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][ドルトン,char_506]
That's no good!
A small wood carving is not a weapon!
It needs to be large or made of heavy and sturdy iron!
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][ラナ,char_528]
Well, there's no need to use it as a weapon, right?
What I want is a model as an ornament!
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][ドルトン,char_506]
Can this eagle make things other than weapons?
As long as I make it,
It must be something that can be used as a weapon!
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][ラナ,char_528]
Don't be so unreasonable!
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][ドルトン,char_506]
Then I won't make an eagle!
Ask someone else!
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][ラナ,char_528]
Even if you say that, you can do such detailed work,
Dalton is the only one on this island!
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][フリード,char_001 Fried]
……sorry.
I can't find a solution either...
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][アリーゼ,char_504]
It's wonderful...
How romantic...
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Alise?
I was in a daze, what happened?
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][アリーゼ,char_504]
I was looking at the ruins...
It's so beautiful lit by the setting sun...
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Ruins?
ah I see.
It looks like it's glowing in the setting sun.
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][アリーゼ,char_504]
A long time ago ~ the people who made this ~...
We were looking at the same scenery...
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][アリーゼ,char_504]
Ancient lovers...
We vowed our love to each other in front of these ruins...
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Huh~.
Alise is surprisingly romantic.)
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][アリーゼ,char_504]
Ancient thieves...
The whereabouts of the stolen treasure...
Carve it somewhere in the ruins...
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (...huh?
The story is going in a strange direction...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][アリーゼ,char_504]
The lovers realized this...
Let's go on an adventure together hand in hand in search of treasure...
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][アリーゼ,char_504]
However, there is a rival aiming for the treasure...
Secretly chasing after the two of them...
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, uh... Alise?
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][アリーゼ,char_504]
The battle to catch up and chase begins soon!
In each direction...
Of course, the traps set by the thieves will also stand in your way!
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][アリーゼ,char_504]
Will it be the lovers who get the treasure?
Or is it a rival?
Oh, how wonderful!
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Wonderful...I wonder...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (At first they said they were lovers, but
All of a sudden we start talking about what happened to the treasure...
(Just like Hans)
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Maybe, Alise?
Does that mean you look more like Hans than you thought?
I'm kind of worried...about a lot of things)
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Ki, Kill Maria?
What is that coin hanging on the thread?
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Hehehe, actually.
In the literature I happened to be reading,
It contains the secrets of hypnosis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][パニス,char_002 Panis]
What is saiminjutsu?
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Putting a person in a hypnotic state...that is, putting them to sleep,
It's a way to manipulate someone to get your way.
------------------------------------------------
[00000083][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
For example, letting them walk around while sleeping,
Making people think they are animals or birds...
------------------------------------------------
[00000084][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Really!? Awesome!
do it! 　
------------------------------------------------
[00000085][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Thanks for your cooperation!
I would also like to ask someone,
It's something I've been wanting to try!
------------------------------------------------
[00000086][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Now, take a look at this coin.
May I?
Mr. Panis, you are getting sleepy...
------------------------------------------------
[00000087][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Excited...
------------------------------------------------
[00000088][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Does hypnosis really work?
Panis, instead of getting sleepy, he got excited.
Although my eyes are wide open...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000089][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (I'm talking about Kill Maria, not Panis)
The punch line is that I will fall asleep...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000090][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I feel sleepy... sleepy... sleepy...
Kuu...
------------------------------------------------
[00000091][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Ah, I knew it.
Kilmaria, wake up!
It's Kill Maria!
------------------------------------------------
[00000092][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Kill Maria...
------------------------------------------------
[00000093][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed!
Wake up! Wake up!
Freed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000094][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Ha!
Oh, what!? What on earth am I...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000095][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed, were you sleeping?
While looking at Kill Maria's coins...
------------------------------------------------
[00000096][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I was surprised...
------------------------------------------------
[00000097][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000098][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (I fell asleep too!?)
------------------------------------------------
[00000099][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Hmmmm...I see.
Kourinmaru-san walks like that.
informative.
------------------------------------------------
[00000100][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Mo-moi!
------------------------------------------------
[00000101][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Killmaria-san, what are you doing?
------------------------------------------------
[00000102][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Are you playing with Kourinmaru?
Let's play Panis too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000103][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
No, this is different.
Observing Kourinmaru-san,
I am allowed to sketch it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000104][フリード,char_001 Fried]
observation?
------------------------------------------------
[00000105][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Kourinmaru is a spirit who lived in the ruins,
By observing their natural appearance,
I thought he might be of some use to the investigation.
------------------------------------------------
[00000106][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, that's right...
------------------------------------------------
[00000107][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Come on, Kourinmaru-san!
Thank you for your continued observation!
------------------------------------------------
[00000108][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Mo-moi...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000109][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Kourinmaru is feeling a bit awkward...
------------------------------------------------
[00000110][フリード,char_001 Fried]
You're really nervous, aren't you?
Is this a "natural look"?
------------------------------------------------
[00000111][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
OK! Next, do a pose from a 45 degree diagonal to the right!
------------------------------------------------
[00000112][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Yes!
------------------------------------------------
[00000113][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
That's good, that's good!
Now, let's do a retrospective pose!
------------------------------------------------
[00000114][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Yay!
------------------------------------------------
[00000115][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (...I guess it's just an observation...
This is a situation I don't quite understand.)
------------------------------------------------
[00000116][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Well, they seem satisfied,
Is that okay?)
------------------------------------------------
[00000117][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hello Kilmaria,
...Oh, my sister and Jinga came too?
------------------------------------------------
[00000118][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Mr. Freed and Mr. Panis!
You've come to the right place!
------------------------------------------------
[00000119][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I came to deliver bread as usual.
------------------------------------------------
[00000120][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I thought it would be boring if I just had bread every day.
I brought some grilled fish.
------------------------------------------------
[00000121][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I am very grateful for your feelings,
I can't eat it all by myself...
------------------------------------------------
[00000122][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Eat panis too!
I eat a lot of bread and fish!
------------------------------------------------
[00000123][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree.
Since we're here, let's all eat together.
The weather is nice and it might be perfect for a picnic.
------------------------------------------------
[00000124][パニス,char_002 Panis]
yay! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000125][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Jinga looks really delicious
You're eating fish.
------------------------------------------------
[00000126][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Ou!
Cook and eat the fish you caught yourself!
There's no better food than this!
------------------------------------------------
[00000127][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hehe.
Grilled fish is good too, but
You can't beat freshly baked bread.
------------------------------------------------
[00000128][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Zinga likes fish, and Shannon likes bread.
Kilmaria, what do you like most about food?
------------------------------------------------
[00000129][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Is it me? I agree……
It's hard to throw away fish and bread, but
If you say it's the best...
------------------------------------------------
[00000130][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
We had a feast at a village on the plateau where we had stopped before.
The taste of ice cream made with freshly squeezed milk
I can not forget!
------------------------------------------------
[00000131][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I also like ice cream and panis!
My aunt makes it for me sometimes!
------------------------------------------------
[00000132][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Then, I made it as a midnight snack while camping.
Barbecued Shimofuri lizard and green pepper,
It was very flavorful!
------------------------------------------------
[00000133][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
that's right!
Speaking of camping, there's also the taste of marshmallows roasted over a bonfire.
Something special again...
------------------------------------------------
[00000134][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Hey, we're running out of limits.
------------------------------------------------
[00000135][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Kilmaria-san, you have a lot of favorite foods.
------------------------------------------------
[00000136][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
This is a problem...
I have so many favorite foods that I can't decide which one is the best!
------------------------------------------------
[00000137][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
My favorite food is
What on earth is it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000138][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, even if you ask me...
------------------------------------------------
[00000139][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, Peter. It's rare that you come to the ruins.
What are you doing?
------------------------------------------------
[00000140][ピーター,char_520]
Hi Freed, Panis.
I was just thinking about it while watching the sunset...
------------------------------------------------
[00000141][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Thoughts?
------------------------------------------------
[00000142][ピーター,char_520]
Yeah, about my ranch.
How can we make animals more comfortable?
Will I be able to live there?
------------------------------------------------
[00000143][ピーター,char_520]
If we do that, we can see more kinds of animals.
You will be able to keep a lot of pets,
Because it will make everyone happy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000144][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's right……
Peter is definitely thinking about the future.
That's great...
------------------------------------------------
[00000145][ピーター,char_520]
Well, it's not great...
But it's a ranch that's important to the whole family.
I want to do even better in the future.
------------------------------------------------
[00000146][ピーター,char_520]
Freed doesn't think about it?
Things like what to do in the future.
------------------------------------------------
[00000147][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, me?
I...I guess so...
------------------------------------------------
[00000148][ピーター,char_520]
Are you going to help out at the bakery?
------------------------------------------------
[00000149][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hmm...the bakery is nice too, but...
There are many other things I would like to try...
------------------------------------------------
[00000150][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But, when it comes to the future,
on second thoughts……
------------------------------------------------
[00000151][パニス,char_002 Panis]
……Fe? Why are you looking at Panis?
------------------------------------------------
[00000152][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Huh!? It's nothing!
It's nothing, Panis!
never mind!
------------------------------------------------
[00000153][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Well, that's why Peter!
I don't care about the future that much.
I haven't thought about it yet! Sorry!
------------------------------------------------
[00000154][ピーター,char_520]
Hahaha! Well then, next time,
I wonder if I could listen to it even when Panis isn't around.
Find out more details!
------------------------------------------------
[00000155][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hey, hey!
Are you really listening?
------------------------------------------------
[00000156][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Of course I'm listening.
However...I'm sorry,
Could you please wait a while?
------------------------------------------------
[00000157][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I'm not kidding when I say wait!
I'm not a lazy person.
Do you have any idea where the "power" is hidden?
------------------------------------------------
[00000158][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Do you have any idea? I agree……
After deciphering this ancient script,
About half a day east from here...
------------------------------------------------
[00000159][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
“Power” is hidden, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000160][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
no.
There is a possibility that there is another stone monument...
------------------------------------------------
[00000161][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Huh!?
Who is listening to that!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000162][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Um, Velvet?
What were you so angry about earlier?
Are you there?
------------------------------------------------
[00000163][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It's probably because you aren't listening!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000164][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I need "power"!
My hunch is that somewhere in this ruins
There must be a clue as to its location!
------------------------------------------------
[00000165][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Is that what you meant?
So, can you help us investigate the ruins?
------------------------------------------------
[00000166][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Huh?
No, there's nothing like that...
------------------------------------------------
[00000167][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
thank you!
I never thought I would receive valuable help just when I was busy!
This will also be the guidance of Justice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000168][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What did you decide on your own?
I told you!? I don't have free time either!
This is not the time to be helping you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000169][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Now, let's start with the classification of these ancient characters...
Kyaah!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000170][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Ah, ah, too! What are you doing!
I didn't fall down and scatter all the papers!
You are really clumsy!
------------------------------------------------
[00000171][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
sorry……
Ah, the documents are falling apart...
------------------------------------------------
[00000172][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I'll take great care of you.
Come on, I'll help you.
Pick it up without looking at me either.
------------------------------------------------
[00000173][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Oh, thank you very much!
Oh, what a kind person you are!
This is also thanks to Justice's guidance...
------------------------------------------------
[00000174][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Da-karara!
Don't look at me and move your hands!
------------------------------------------------
[00000175][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Oh, I understand!
------------------------------------------------
[00000176][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (while saying something,
In the end, I'm helping Kill Maria...
Velvet-san is surprisingly caring.)
------------------------------------------------
[00000177][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Moimoi?
------------------------------------------------
[00000178][バッカス,char_527]
You know what I'm saying!
I'll get angry if it ends!
------------------------------------------------
[00000179][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Hmm? That's... Bacchus!?)
------------------------------------------------
[00000180][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Yes...
------------------------------------------------
[00000181][バッカス,char_527]
Don't worry about it!
Shut up and listen to me!
------------------------------------------------
[00000182][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (No way... are you trying to take Kourinmaru with you!?
Don’t let that happen…)
------------------------------------------------
[00000183][バッカス,char_527]
Okay?
If I give you a hand,
Do it like this, like this!
------------------------------------------------
[00000184][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Moi! Moimoi!
------------------------------------------------
[00000185][バッカス,char_527]
It seems so! You can do it if you try!
Well, let's try it again.
------------------------------------------------
[00000186][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Too♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000187][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (...what, are you just playing?)
------------------------------------------------
[00000188][バッカス,char_527]
Got it? Let's go.
Hands!
------------------------------------------------
[00000189][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Yes!
------------------------------------------------
[00000190][バッカス,char_527]
Um...what should I do with my chin sticking out?
Are you handy? Hands!
------------------------------------------------
[00000191][バッカス,char_527]
Okay? I'll tell you all about it.
This is what I mean when I say “hand”!
You can't make a mistake again, can you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000192][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Moimoi!
------------------------------------------------
[00000193][バッカス,char_527]
Hands!
...It's not a tail, it's a tail.
You did it on purpose, didn't you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000194][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Moi~?
Moi, moi♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000195][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (...If anything, I feel like I'm being played with.)
------------------------------------------------
[00000196][バッカス,char_527]
He's a terrible person.
...Hey, aren't you getting hungry by now?
I'll share your lunch with you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000197][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Yes~♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000198][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Well, they both look like they're having fun so I'll leave them alone)
------------------------------------------------
[00000199][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
...And so, on this stone monument,
The natural environment of this island at that time was
Seems to be detailed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000200][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I see, I had no idea that such a record still exists.
Indeed, this ruin is
It's a treasure trove for those interested in history.
------------------------------------------------
[00000201][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Levin, you're very enthusiastic.
------------------------------------------------
[00000202][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
……yeah?
Hey, aren't you a boy?
------------------------------------------------
[00000203][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Hello, Mr. Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000204][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hello.
Levin, what kind of wind are you blowing?
How can you suddenly become interested in ruins?
------------------------------------------------
[00000205][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Because they listen to me very enthusiastically,
I also have something to explain!
------------------------------------------------
[00000206][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Well, there's no deep reason.
However, regarding the place that becomes your territory,
I thought it would be good to know more about it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000207][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Still saying...
This island will become Levin's territory.
There's no way that can happen.
------------------------------------------------
[00000208][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
However, throughout history, changes in authorities and governing institutions have been
How many times do you see it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000209][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Mr. Kilmaria...
Something like this island becoming Levin's.
I wish you wouldn't say it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000210][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
……Ah! I never meant it that way.
That's not what I said...
------------------------------------------------
[00000211][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Ha ha ha!
Well, I hope that doesn't happen,
Work hard to hone your skills, boy!
------------------------------------------------
[00000212][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Which one, Mr. Kilmaria? I'll ask you to continue the lecture.
What happened to that stone monument?
------------------------------------------------
[00000213][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
S-Sensei...?
Ha, yes!! I'll be presumptuous and explain it to you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000214][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Maybe I should listen to it too.
It might be of some use.
------------------------------------------------
[00000215][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Oh, that's fine!
Rejoice, teacher, the number of students has increased to two.
------------------------------------------------
[00000216][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Ah...I can't believe I'm a teacher...
I'm kind of excited!
------------------------------------------------
[00000217][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Mr. Kilmaria...
Please don't get too excited and continue the explanation...
------------------------------------------------
[00000218][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Panis, Freed, Hello.
Maybe a walk?
------------------------------------------------
[00000219][パニス,char_002 Panis]
a!  Hello!
Hey, I came to play!
Viola, let's play together!
------------------------------------------------
[00000220][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Me and? What do you play?
------------------------------------------------
[00000221][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hmm, hmm...
------------------------------------------------
[00000222][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Geez...
Ah, that's right!
Do you know what a cradle is?
------------------------------------------------
[00000223][パニス,char_002 Panis]
what is that? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000224][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Well then, let's try it.
Make this string into a loop like this...
------------------------------------------------
[00000225][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Oh!The broom is ready!
------------------------------------------------
[00000226][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Hehehe, you're not that good.
Panis is quick to learn.
------------------------------------------------
[00000227][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Ehehehe...
Thanks, Viola!
I love Viola because she teaches me so easily!
------------------------------------------------
[00000228][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
I……
kind……?
------------------------------------------------
[00000229][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah!
------------------------------------------------
[00000230][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
yes……
A while ago, I thought about you...
And yet...
------------------------------------------------
[00000231][パニス,char_002 Panis]
picture? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000232][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
...No, no, it's nothing.
...Thank you, Panis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000233][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
I also love how kind you are!
------------------------------------------------
[00000234][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
So what about the power source?
About the power of that ancient weapon.
Viola-san, do you know anything?
------------------------------------------------
[00000235][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
That's...
Hi・mi・tsu♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000236][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Is that it again!
Please answer seriously!
------------------------------------------------
[00000237][フリード,char_001 Fried]
what happened?
What are you worried about?
------------------------------------------------
[00000238][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Oh, Freed, you're in the right place.
Hey...could you please help me?
------------------------------------------------
[00000239][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Mr. Freed, you're in the right place!
Please, please convince Viola!
This will not allow the investigation to proceed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000240][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's annoying to hear something like that all at once...
First of all, could you please explain what's going on?
------------------------------------------------
[00000241][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
You'll know it when you see it, right?
This kid is bombarding me with questions.
------------------------------------------------
[00000242][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Viola, no matter what question you ask,
I end up cheating by saying “hi・mi・tsu♪”!
I don't think this is a very serious attitude!
------------------------------------------------
[00000243][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
There are questions that can be answered and questions that cannot be answered.
I feel bad too...
------------------------------------------------
[00000244][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I see.
I understand how Kilmaria feels, but
She probably has a position as well, Viola-san.
------------------------------------------------
[00000245][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Mumumu……
So, Viola, last question.
Please answer seriously.
------------------------------------------------
[00000246][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Why can't you answer my question?
If someone is keeping you quiet, who is it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000247][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
it is……
------------------------------------------------
[00000248][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
"Hi-mi-tsu♪" is prohibited!
------------------------------------------------
[00000249][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Huh?
------------------------------------------------
[00000250][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I should have asked you to be serious!
Come on, Viola-san!? Please answer!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000251][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
That's...um...
------------------------------------------------
[00000252][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
What...
Na-i-sho♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000253][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
What is that?!
Not serious at all!
This is a gross violation of justice!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000254][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
I-I'm sorry.
Freed, please wait.
------------------------------------------------
[00000255][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Ah! It's cowardly to run away!
Viola-san, please come back!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000256][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Even if you ask me to come back...
Viola-san, that's impossible...
------------------------------------------------
