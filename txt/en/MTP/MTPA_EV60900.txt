[00000000][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
No, nothing.
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Will everyone in the village be able to live in peace from now on?
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Viola, how old are you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
You look like you want to ask me something, Freed.
Well... you can ask me just one question.
However, there are some questions that cannot be answered.
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Oh, so you don't force me to ask?
Hehe, you're so kind, Freed.
But I don't dislike that kind of consideration.
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
That's an abstract question.
I guess that's up to you guys.
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
You just have to work hard to make it happen.
……Right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Oh, is that a question?
The answer is, hi-mi-tsu, yo.
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Okay, Freed?
Is it taboo to ask a woman her age?
Be careful.
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
...Oh, nothing?
It's a shame because I gave you a chance.
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
This island is really cozy...
I feel like I'm forgetting my mission...
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
That note is very interesting...
I wonder if there are other ruins as well...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
I hear that ancient wars were truly horrific...
That note tells a part of the story...
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
We who live today will never make the same mistake.
And I can't let the same sadness happen again...
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
"Thor"...
I never wanted to hear that name again...
But this is also part of my mission...
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
The bread I buy at Shannon's is delicious.
I end up eating too much...
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Aaah...
No matter how much you eat, you won't gain weight
I'm jealous of Panis...
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Mary came to me recently.
She comes to hear me sing.
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
The way they sing with all their might,
It made me smile so much...
It makes me feel really happy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Even if it's not a new product, my sister's bread is delicious, isn't it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Sorry, I can't think of anything right now...
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
stop! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
To commemorate my return to the island,
She wants to make some new bread.
Do you have any good ideas?
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
yes?It makes me kind of happy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Well then, since it's a big deal,
For Freed and Panis,
Let's bake some delicious bread♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Can't think of any?　Za-n-nen.　
Well then, if you have any ideas, let me know!
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What is that? Are you saying my bread tastes bad?
already! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...Why do you look so hopeless and stay silent?
If you have something to say, say it clearly!
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I'll make the best bread today!
I came up with a very innovative recipe!
Freed, please have a taste♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It seems like this island still has some secrets.
...Well, that made me realize that.
Viola herself is full of secrets.
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
The person who wrote that note...
I had a small child and was involved in a war...
It must have been tough...
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I know that this island is peaceful now.
I have to feel happy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
No matter what kind of weapon Thor is,
Peaceful daily life has finally returned,
I have to stop it no matter what!
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I made a new bread
Why can't everyone try it?
This time I'm proud of my work...
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
My bread is very popular, so delivery is difficult.
Freed, don't just play with Panis.
Please help me once in a while!
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
No, I still don't drink alcohol...
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
nice! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I don't like alcohol. I never drink.
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
A lot happened, but it seems like things have calmed down somehow.
This finally settles the matter.
How about Freed, would you like to have a drink?
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Oh, of course I know!
It's just a joke. Don't take it seriously!
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
When you're old enough to drink,
Let's drink to our heart's content.
I'm already looking forward to that time!
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
...Hey, you can't be serious, can you?
I was joking but...
Freed, it's still too early for you to drink alcohol.
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
……Is it so?
No, of course I was joking,
I guess each person has their own preferences...
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Really. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
...Hey, don't worry so seriously.
Just kidding, kidding.
You're not old enough to drink alcohol yet, are you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Ah! Damn it!
I caught a really big fish today.
When I was about to take one more step, the thread broke!
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Is true! It was such a huge fish!
Freed, you'll believe me, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Anyway, Bacchus' hideout
I had no idea it was in a place like that...
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
never again,
I don't want a war to break out on this island.
I can't imagine everyone in the village being drawn into a war.
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
...No, I don't even want to imagine it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I don't know if it's Thor or something, but
If something is dangerous to this village, we will destroy it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Someday, I'll catch a huge fish,
I want to catch it with just my power.
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Our ship "Blue Noah"...
All in all, this is a really nice ship.
Freed, you think so too, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Adam really likes farming.
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Adam can do what he wants, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Adam is an ancient weapon, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Huh...
After all, when I am working on a farm,
The program becomes stable.
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
yes. This seems more suitable.
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Of course, who would cause harm to the village?
I will fight with all my might!
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
thank you.
However, what I want to do is
This is farming.
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
……yes.
That's right, weapons are suitable for agricultural work, etc.
It is wierd, is not it? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
very sorry. Now, let's get back to farming.
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Working on the farm gives me a warm feeling.
If you put that kind of spirit into your work, your crops will grow vigorously.
It's true?
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
The ruins of this island
Looks like I'll have to investigate again.
It's going to be another busy day.
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Based on data obtained from notes and other sources,
Simulate ancient warfare,
I tried to calculate the estimated damage.
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
As a result, the probability that humans will escape extinction is extremely low.
The result is.
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
In other words, the reason why you are here now is
That means I'm very lucky.
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Thanks to everyone for listening,
My confused memory and processing unit
Optimized.
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Conversation has a mysterious power.
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Analyzing the disk.
Please wait for a while.
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
In addition, even during the disk analysis process, I
It is possible to do farm work at the same time.
It supports so-called multitasking.
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
When there is no need for activity,
Sleep mode saves energy.
It's similar to human sleep.
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
while growing plants
The operations around the thought program become stable.
It seems that agriculture is suitable for me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
sorry. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
No, it's not really of much use...
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
It's no big deal, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Ah, Mr. Freed!
I'm sorry, but please leave the discussion for later!
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I've been very busy and have a lot of things to do.
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
No, that's me too.
Because I followed Justice,
Don't worry.
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
However, there is still a lot to do!
I was slacking off on training, research, and everything...
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Ah! Where should I start?
When I think about it, I get stuck...
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
is that so.
Well then, please excuse me.
I get things done.
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Impolite!
The training of the exorcist and the investigation of the ruins are
This is very important for Justice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000083][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
...Well, the latter is also my hobby.
------------------------------------------------
[00000084][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Well then, good day.
------------------------------------------------
[00000085][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Making new discoveries and gaining knowledge.
These things are my purpose in life.
------------------------------------------------
[00000086][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Stepping into a world you've never known before,
That feeling is indescribably comfortable...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000087][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
From the notes, I will explain the situation at the time and the author's thoughts.
You can read it in detail.
This is truly an amazing historical document!
------------------------------------------------
[00000088][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
But at the same time, from what is written
I felt an indescribable sadness,
It makes me sad...
------------------------------------------------
[00000089][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
It even changes the terrain and climate.
What a fierce war it was...
------------------------------------------------
[00000090][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
The suffering and sadness of the people who were in the middle of it,
And when I think of fear,
I too feel heartbroken...
------------------------------------------------
[00000091][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
What is called a disk?
No matter what information is recorded...
No, there's no problem even if you don't have any information!
------------------------------------------------
[00000092][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
If Thor and the others are evil, just exorcise them!
All in the name of heaven, earth, and justice!
Mr. Freed, let's do our best!
------------------------------------------------
[00000093][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
There are so many things I want to research and not enough time.
Even if you try to cut down on your sleep time,
A living body naturally has its limits...
------------------------------------------------
[00000094][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Adam doesn't need to sleep,
I'm so jealous...
------------------------------------------------
[00000095][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I'm not good at ships...
In fact, I get drunk easily.
------------------------------------------------
[00000096][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Maybe because of that,
I can't seem to get used to naval battles...
------------------------------------------------
[00000097][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Where to start, Mr. Velvet?
------------------------------------------------
[00000098][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Good luck, Velvet.
------------------------------------------------
[00000099][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Let's take it easy, Velvet...
------------------------------------------------
[00000100][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Well, the Panis incident has settled down,
I couldn't even bring back my "power" from another world...
We need to restart our search for "power" here.
------------------------------------------------
[00000101][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Oh, you're so proactive, Freed♪
Sister, I'm so happy♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000102][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I researched all the ruins,
Maybe a different approach is needed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000103][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I'll call you once I've decided on a strategy for the search.
Thank you for your time, Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000104][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What, are you talking like it's someone else's problem?
I'm looking for you too! Did you forget the contract?
------------------------------------------------
[00000105][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Until I get paid,
I won't leave you guys. Be prepared♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000106][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
...That's unusual for you to say.
Are you really tired?
------------------------------------------------
[00000107][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
...Well, it's just a soliloquy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000108][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I am also completely in love with this village.
It's become like a vigilante group.
I feel like I'm forgetting my real job as a pirate.
------------------------------------------------
[00000109][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Anyway...when it comes to pirates these days!
It's like it has no texture or guts!
In that case, Bacchus is still better!
------------------------------------------------
[00000110][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
A re-examination of the ruins...
I think I can finally get my hands on the secret of "power"!
It's been a long time since I've been so excited!
------------------------------------------------
[00000111][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
The person who left that note,
It must have been very unsettling.
When he thinks about his child's future...
------------------------------------------------
[00000112][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That ancient weapon called Thor
Isn't that the "power" I was looking for?
------------------------------------------------
[00000113][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What a shame.
No matter how great the power,
There's no point if you can't control it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000114][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
This island is a very comfortable place to spend time.
The climate is mild and the food is delicious.
------------------------------------------------
[00000115][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Living in such a relaxing place,
Like you guys,
It's no wonder the weather is so bad...
------------------------------------------------
[00000116][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hey, Adam's facial expressions have changed lately.
I'm starting to understand!
This is just me, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000117][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
……picture? That's right...it's kind of a shame.
------------------------------------------------
[00000118][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
But does this mean I'm getting used to it too?
Aran, sister, I'm so happy♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000119][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I haven't forgotten.
------------------------------------------------
[00000120][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Is that so?
------------------------------------------------
[00000121][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
...Are you still saying that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000122][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Let me remind you once again, boy.
I want to own this island someday
Is it because you think so?
------------------------------------------------
[00000123][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hmm, then that's fine. This is just a temporary truce,
It was just a temporary alliance.
Don't forget that, okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000124][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
...Well, today and tomorrow,
I'm not trying to discard it, so don't worry.
------------------------------------------------
[00000125][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hey, please, Freed.
Have you lost your mind after a big battle?
------------------------------------------------
[00000126][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I'll settle things with you eventually. Don't forget?
------------------------------------------------
[00000127][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
...That's unexpected, Freed.
Did you think I was the kind of guy who could easily change words?
------------------------------------------------
[00000128][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
...How should I interpret that silence?
------------------------------------------------
[00000129][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I feel like I've been getting a lot of attention lately...
Is this that?　
Are the village ladies even coming to take a peek at me?
------------------------------------------------
[00000130][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
No, it's here!
It's tough being a popular guy, boy!
------------------------------------------------
[00000131][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Exploring ruins is
There are similarities with piracy.
Yes, there's a guy's romance.
------------------------------------------------
[00000132][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Listen, Freed.
Even in war, there are rules and
We need something like decency.
------------------------------------------------
[00000133][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
It's no good if you hate your opponent.
Don't cause trouble to people other than soldiers.
Even when fighting over countries, this is the minimum rule.
------------------------------------------------
[00000134][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Those who can't protect this guy,
In the end, you will end up self-destructing.
Remember that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000135][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
What kind of thing is that Thor?
What is written on the disc etc.
I'm really looking forward to it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000136][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I can't forgive these incompetent pirates trying to take over the island!
This island is mine! Hey, boy!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000137][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
...Hey, boy. Don't look so scary.
------------------------------------------------
[00000138][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Looking at the farm from here,
You'll feel relaxed and like you're on the ocean.
------------------------------------------------
[00000139][ガルゼー,char_501]
The village is completely back to normal.
The only way to maintain this peace is to
It is my duty and my purpose in life.
------------------------------------------------
[00000140][ガルゼー,char_501]
This incident started with a giant attack,
Having a home and being able to live peacefully,
I realized how happy I am.
------------------------------------------------
[00000141][ガルゼー,char_501]
Hey Panis!
Panis-chan is doing well today too...
Soncho is happy too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000142][ジム,char_502]
Do your best!
------------------------------------------------
[00000143][ジム,char_502]
Even if you call me a hero...
------------------------------------------------
[00000144][ジム,char_502]
I'm not really a hero...
------------------------------------------------
[00000145][ジム,char_502]
I helped you with things like Panis and the other world, but
I won't make a sweet face anymore!
------------------------------------------------
[00000146][ジム,char_502]
This time, I'll do it for you
I'll become the village hero!
------------------------------------------------
[00000147][ジム,char_502]
Ou! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000148][ジム,char_502]
...That's not true!
------------------------------------------------
[00000149][ジム,char_502]
What's with that slow response?
Well, watch it now.
------------------------------------------------
[00000150][ジム,char_502]
After I became very popular and popular,
Don't hide your face!
------------------------------------------------
[00000151][ジム,char_502]
What, are you trying to be humble?
The way you acted like a good girl,
It's so funny!
------------------------------------------------
[00000152][ジム,char_502]
Hehe, I can't seem to even say the word frightened.
Well, of course!
------------------------------------------------
[00000153][ジム,char_502]
Okay, Freed?
It wasn't just your power that saved the other world, right?
There's a little bit of my power in there too!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000154][ジム,char_502]
Don't forget that!
------------------------------------------------
[00000155][ジム,char_502]
Zynga's big brother is my idol!
strong! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000156][ジム,char_502]
The same goes for my brother when he's fighting.
Big brother is also super cool when he goes fishing!
Freed, you think so too!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000157][ジム,char_502]
Okay? Don't think you're the only ones protecting the village?
Even we vigilantes are fighting!
------------------------------------------------
[00000158][マイア,char_503]
A treasure said to be on this island...
------------------------------------------------
[00000159][マイア,char_503]
...I'm sure it's the smiles on the children's faces!
------------------------------------------------
[00000160][マイア,char_503]
Panis-chan is always in good spirits.
Just see her walking through the village with a smile on her face,
I feel like everyone in the village will be energized!
------------------------------------------------
[00000161][マイア,char_503]
Peace is best above all else.
Panis and her children are playing together happily
That's what I think from the bottom of my heart as I look at this heart-warming scene.
------------------------------------------------
[00000162][アリーゼ,char_504]
I'm glad that peace has returned to the village.
Dad is going on an adventure again!
------------------------------------------------
[00000163][アリーゼ,char_504]
Thanks to you, the shop is too busy.
There's no peace at all!
------------------------------------------------
[00000164][アリーゼ,char_504]
My father's adventure story...
Have you heard of it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000165][アリーゼ,char_504]
It's kind of popular, isn't it?
There are quite a few customers who are looking for that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000166][アリーゼ,char_504]
It's a problem for my father to go on an adventure, but...
The customers are looking forward to hearing about it.
It's hard to say not to go...
------------------------------------------------
[00000167][アリーゼ,char_504]
There are as many monsters as there are stars on this island.
Even if you get rid of them, they will come back again.
------------------------------------------------
[00000168][アリーゼ,char_504]
Because requests for subjugation never end,
Please take it as much as you like!
I asked for it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000169][ダイアナ,char_505]
I... am I really drunk right now...?
Just kidding, kidding...hehehehehehe...
------------------------------------------------
[00000170][ダイアナ,char_505]
Hey, do you have recovery items ready...?
If you don't have it, you'll regret it during the battle...?
hehehehe……
------------------------------------------------
[00000171][ダイアナ,char_505]
Hey, how is my shop...?
More unusual items...
Should I leave it there...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000172][ダイアナ,char_505]
picture……? Yes...then you can rest assured...hehehehehe...
------------------------------------------------
[00000173][ドルトン,char_506]
I like making weapons, and I'm good at it.
But what I really want is a world where weapons are unnecessary.
I want it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000174][ドルトン,char_506]
...Oh my god. Gah ha ha!
------------------------------------------------
[00000175][ドルトン,char_506]
What I seek is the ultimate weapon...
I'll be swinging the hammer every day until I can make that one swing...
------------------------------------------------
[00000176][ドルトン,char_506]
Wake up in the morning, train your weapons, and go to bed at night...
At that turning point, I hear the sound of a bell...
------------------------------------------------
[00000177][ドルトン,char_506]
That is the joy of living in this village,
It's the best relief for me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000178][ロラン,char_507]
When I grow up, I'm going to join Gikaidan!
After all, protecting the peace of the village is...
It's so cool!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000179][ロラン,char_507]
I want to grow up quickly and join Gikaidan.
What would be a good weapon at that time?
------------------------------------------------
[00000180][ロラン,char_507]
Is it Ken like Freed...?
Kill Maria's Nicho Kenju is also good...
Levin's Juken is also cool!
------------------------------------------------
[00000181][ロラン,char_507]
Panis, do you know?
Mr Maia is
It's so scary when it happens, isn't it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000182][ロラン,char_507]
Ahhh!
Don't tell Maia-sensei now!
He's always so kind!
------------------------------------------------
[00000183][カール,char_508]
It would be nice if Freed could always hold hands with Panis!
I also want to hold hands sometimes...
------------------------------------------------
[00000184][カール,char_508]
I made a mistake the other day about Mr. Maia.
I said "mom"...
------------------------------------------------
[00000185][カール,char_508]
But, Mr. Maia, please don't get mad.
He said, "Hey, Karl?"
Good idea?
------------------------------------------------
[00000186][カール,char_508]
Hey Panis, do you like me?
As for me...
------------------------------------------------
[00000187][カール,char_508]
I love Panis so much!
------------------------------------------------
[00000188][メリー,char_509]
What does that mean?
------------------------------------------------
[00000189][メリー,char_509]
Oh, leave it to me!
------------------------------------------------
[00000190][メリー,char_509]
Can I protect it...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000191][メリー,char_509]
Okay, Freed?
About you Panis,
Will you continue to protect me?
------------------------------------------------
[00000192][メリー,char_509]
Ah, even though I know~♪
I'm a man, so when it comes to making decisions
Decide with a bang!
------------------------------------------------
[00000193][メリー,char_509]
...That's no good.
It's like I don't understand.
Well, maybe that's the good thing about Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000194][メリー,char_509]
Hey Freed!
As a man, you should take care of that!
------------------------------------------------
[00000195][メリー,char_509]
...There's no point in being silent, Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000196][メリー,char_509]
Freed is always holding hands with Panis.
Don't show off too much to Shannon.
...You understand, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000197][メリー,char_509]
Panis is a good singer!
I also love singing,
I want you to tell me the Panis songs you know!
------------------------------------------------
[00000198][メリー,char_509]
Kill Maria isn't looking straight ahead when walking, right?
Because I'm always walking while reading a big book!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000199][ハンス,char_510]
When the island is peaceful, you can enjoy adventure...
After all, there are many ruins and caves on this island.
I really don't get tired of it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000200][ハンス,char_510]
Looks like you guys did a good job.
I'm sorry I couldn't lend a hand.
------------------------------------------------
[00000201][ハンス,char_510]
I often leave the village for adventures,
I'll definitely come running when the time comes!
------------------------------------------------
[00000202][ハンス,char_510]
Even if Alise stops me or cries, I'm going!
Because I'm an adventurer!
The ruins are calling me!
------------------------------------------------
[00000203][ボリス,char_511]
Eagles come to this cove every day without fail.
They say that continuity is power.
If you just keep going, it will give you a lot of strength.
------------------------------------------------
[00000204][ボリス,char_511]
Freed and Panis
Is there anything you continue to do?
------------------------------------------------
[00000205][ボリス,char_511]
Take a walk from the square to this cove,
It's my daily routine to relax and look at the sea.
------------------------------------------------
[00000206][ボリス,char_511]
The sea is nice!
It's full of manly romance.
------------------------------------------------
[00000207][ボリス,char_511]
If you are having trouble or have a hard time,
Come to this cove.
------------------------------------------------
[00000208][ボリス,char_511]
While watching the sun set on the horizon,
Shout out loud to the sea.
All your petty worries will be blown away.
------------------------------------------------
[00000209][デボラ,char_512]
That guy Levin is quite handsome.
He looks exactly like the man who approached me a long time ago.
------------------------------------------------
[00000210][デボラ,char_512]
Inside the farm, there is a gentle slope.
Be careful not to fall while running around.
------------------------------------------------
[00000211][デボラ,char_512]
Panis-chan, it would be nice if you could help me.
I'll protect Freed as well, okay?
That's right, would you both like some sweets?
------------------------------------------------
[00000212][ハイラム,char_513]
I think it's time for me to retire and relax.
Adam took over the farm admirably.
Is it just a matter of watching the children grow up?
------------------------------------------------
[00000213][ハイラム,char_513]
Ah, but the elf's retirement seems like a long time...
It seems boring, so I'll stop.
------------------------------------------------
[00000214][ハイラム,char_513]
Every morning we wake up to the sound of chickens,
I am receiving their eggs.
We receive many benefits from animals.
------------------------------------------------
[00000215][ハイラム,char_513]
Chickens today,
I wonder how many eggs she gave birth to...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000216][ハイラム,char_513]
Who taught Shannon how to bake bread?
It's Rian.
------------------------------------------------
[00000217][ハイラム,char_513]
Leanne is also good at coming up with new recipes.
Bread that will make you feel very happy,
He created several.
------------------------------------------------
[00000218][ハイラム,char_513]
But why is Shannon's new work...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000219][リアン,char_514]
There's nothing that can beat Auntie's bread, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000220][リアン,char_514]
I wanted to see it too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000221][リアン,char_514]
Even if it's something I'm so disappointed in...
------------------------------------------------
[00000222][リアン,char_514]
What kind of bread do they eat in another world?
I wanted to see it if possible...
That's a bit disappointing.
------------------------------------------------
[00000223][リアン,char_514]
Hehehe, thank you, Freed.
I'm glad to hear you say that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000224][リアン,char_514]
But hey, maybe there's some new recipe.
Maybe there was something helpful for you?
Now that I think about it, it's really a shame...
------------------------------------------------
[00000225][リアン,char_514]
That's right.
I'm sure it's something you can't eat in this world.
There must have been some rare bread there.
------------------------------------------------
[00000226][リアン,char_514]
I did something regrettable...
------------------------------------------------
[00000227][リアン,char_514]
Is that so?
Because it's helpful for new recipes.
Maybe there was some rare and delicious bread?
------------------------------------------------
[00000228][リアン,char_514]
Freed has a desire to improve his baking skills.
It seems like it's not enough.
------------------------------------------------
[00000229][リアン,char_514]
Oh, Freed.
Did talking about bread make you hungry?
------------------------------------------------
[00000230][リアン,char_514]
You guys always get along so well.
I sometimes hold hands with Hiram.
Shall we go out? Hehehe.
------------------------------------------------
[00000231][リアン,char_514]
Peter's milk is definitely the best.
You can make really delicious bread.
------------------------------------------------
[00000232][リアン,char_514]
When you eat the vegetables that Hiram makes,
It's very refreshing. That person,
We take care of each and every vegetable.
------------------------------------------------
[00000233][リアン,char_514]
Adam also understands this and explains how to make Hiram.
It seems like he's setting me up as a role model.
Adam's vegetables are also very delicious.
------------------------------------------------
[00000234][ダリオ,char_515]
Although the Panis-related incident has been resolved...
This village is being threatened by monsters and pirates.
Because it won't change.
------------------------------------------------
[00000235][ダリオ,char_515]
That's why I'm making my rounds today as well.
That's the duty of the vigilante group!
------------------------------------------------
[00000236][ダリオ,char_515]
When the village children grow up,
A great vigilante group like us
That's what I want it to be.
------------------------------------------------
[00000237][ダリオ,char_515]
Jim is also a member of the vigilante group.
Moreover, he is supposed to be the leader.
------------------------------------------------
[00000238][ダリオ,char_515]
Well, actually, it doesn't really have anything to do with military strength, but
He thinks about the village in his own way.
I think Freed understands.
------------------------------------------------
[00000239][ミルコ,char_516]
Until now, in this cove,
Lana and Velvet
I wish I had watched over you...
------------------------------------------------
[00000240][ミルコ,char_516]
Lately, Viola has been in the ruins.
I have to watch over you!
Thanks to you, I've been very busy!
------------------------------------------------
[00000241][ミルコ,char_516]
Oh, Viola!
My heart is your sickle
It has been reaped!
------------------------------------------------
[00000242][ミルコ,char_516]
If I were to keep watch like this,
The movements of the pirates are obvious!
------------------------------------------------
[00000243][ミルコ,char_516]
We won't let pirate ships interfere with our trade!
Lana-san, please keep an eye on my activities!
------------------------------------------------
[00000244][ミルコ,char_516]
Please rest assured, Lana and Velvet!
While the two of you are in this cove,
This is how we will continue to protect peace!
------------------------------------------------
[00000245][ミルコ,char_516]
I wish I could say that to myself.
------------------------------------------------
[00000246][ロドリゴ,char_517]
We are also improving our skills a little!
I've been relying on you forever,
They're not pathetic vigilantes!
------------------------------------------------
[00000247][ロドリゴ,char_517]
After completing the village patrol,
Having a drink at Alise's restaurant is
I'm looking forward to it more than anything.
------------------------------------------------
[00000248][ロドリゴ,char_517]
Thanks to the efforts of Freed and Zynga,
We, the vigilante group, are starting to lose weight.
Well, as long as the village is peaceful, it doesn't matter.
------------------------------------------------
[00000249][ロドリゴ,char_517]
But that doesn't mean I can relax.
Monsters and pirates suddenly attack,
Don't let your guard down!
------------------------------------------------
[00000250][ダニエル,char_518]
Lately, there have been times when Peter has seemed awfully mature.
That child is growing up without even realizing it.
As a father, I feel both happy and sad for him...
------------------------------------------------
[00000251][ダニエル,char_518]
The grass is in good condition this year.
With this, sheep too,
It looks like she'll give you a lot of good milk.
------------------------------------------------
[00000252][ダニエル,char_518]
Looking at Peter's work,
It reminds me of my youth.
I was desperate back then...
------------------------------------------------
[00000253][ダニエル,char_518]
Well, Peter is still not a full-fledged man,
I have to try harder.
------------------------------------------------
[00000254][ブレンダ,char_519]
EX Chapter Daytime Conversation
------------------------------------------------
[00000255][ブレンダ,char_519]
Conversations and questions related to likeability
------------------------------------------------
[00000256][ブレンダ,char_519]
Reaction when favorability increases
------------------------------------------------
[00000257][ブレンダ,char_519]
Reaction when favorability remains the same
------------------------------------------------
[00000258][ブレンダ,char_519]
Reaction when favorability drops
------------------------------------------------
[00000259][ブレンダ,char_519]
Reactions to questions when time is up
------------------------------------------------
[00000260][ブレンダ,char_519]
To Daniel when I was young,
He was confessed under a big tree on the ranch.
Therefore, it is a very auspicious place.
------------------------------------------------
[00000261][ブレンダ,char_519]
Why don't Freed go with Panis too?
Ufufufufufu!
------------------------------------------------
[00000262][ブレンダ,char_519]
When Panis-chan comes,
I can see that the animals are happy.
It's also very popular on the farm.
------------------------------------------------
[00000263][ブレンダ,char_519]
During this time, Gon! There was a loud sound,
Just when I was wondering what it was...
Mr. Kilmaria had crashed into a large tree.
------------------------------------------------
[00000264][ブレンダ,char_519]
The habit of walking while thinking,
I think it's better to fix it because it's dangerous.
------------------------------------------------
[00000265][ピーター,char_520]
The animals look happy too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000266][ピーター,char_520]
I think so too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000267][ピーター,char_520]
Will I get bored?
------------------------------------------------
[00000268][ピーター,char_520]
There were various things, but
After all, I live with animals on this island.
It seems to suit me best.
------------------------------------------------
[00000269][ピーター,char_520]
I do not think so? For me, those are the happiest words.
------------------------------------------------
[00000270][ピーター,char_520]
If animals really think that way,
That's fine though.
------------------------------------------------
[00000271][ピーター,char_520]
right?
It was my first time going outside the island,
I was a little excited, but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000272][ピーター,char_520]
After all, I think the relaxing life on this island is the best.
------------------------------------------------
[00000273][ピーター,char_520]
Hmm...I guess Freed is like that.
I'm not boring at all...
------------------------------------------------
[00000274][ピーター,char_520]
Well then, I'll take care of the sheep.
see you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000275][ピーター,char_520]
While working hard on the farm,
I feel like I'm being useful as a member of the village,
I feel a sense of purpose in life.
------------------------------------------------
[00000276][ピーター,char_520]
So that I can say that to my father with confidence,
I'll try harder!
------------------------------------------------
[00000277][ピーター,char_520]
These guys, if you let them get away,
I'm trying to go somewhere right away.
I'm very curious, basically.
------------------------------------------------
[00000278][ピーター,char_520]
It's quite difficult to keep an eye on the animals...
------------------------------------------------
[00000279][ピーター,char_520]
My father is scary when he gets angry, but
He's always thinking about me.
I think he's a little too worried though...
------------------------------------------------
[00000280][ラナ,char_528]
……I do not think so?
------------------------------------------------
[00000281][ラナ,char_528]
A lot of things happened...
------------------------------------------------
[00000282][ラナ,char_528]
Right!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000283][ラナ,char_528]
...While I didn't see her for a while, her face changed.
Have you grown up... or become more manly?
------------------------------------------------
[00000284][ラナ,char_528]
Yes, my responses have become more adult-like.
------------------------------------------------
[00000285][ラナ,char_528]
They say that people grow when they travel.
Not to mention, I went to another world,
Maybe it's obvious.
------------------------------------------------
[00000286][ラナ,char_528]
Anyway, thank you for your hard work, Freed!
And welcome home!
------------------------------------------------
[00000287][ラナ,char_528]
……I see.
Please tell me that story sometime!
------------------------------------------------
[00000288][ラナ,char_528]
……I take it back.
Even if it seems like you're affirming it, it's still a long way off.
------------------------------------------------
[00000289][ラナ,char_528]
...Maybe you don't want to answer because there are too many things going on?
------------------------------------------------
[00000290][ラナ,char_528]
No matter when you come to this village,
The whole village seems to be surrounded by a fun atmosphere.
Just being in the village makes me feel happy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000291][ラナ,char_528]
I'm really glad I came to this village!
------------------------------------------------
[00000292][ラナ,char_528]
If nothing happens during the voyage,
I was so bored that I wondered if a storm would come.
I can't help but think about it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000293][ラナ,char_528]
But that's when it's dangerous!
Being careless is the enemy!
------------------------------------------------
[00000294][ラナ,char_528]
Being a pirate might be surprisingly fun.
Explore unknown waters, gather friends...
------------------------------------------------
[00000295][ラナ,char_528]
But I still can't beat the charm of business!
------------------------------------------------
