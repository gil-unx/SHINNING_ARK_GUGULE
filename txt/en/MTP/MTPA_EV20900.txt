[00000000][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hi Lana!
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][ラナ,char_528]
Freed, you look healthy as always.
How are you, Angel?
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Aren't you an angel? It's Panis?
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][ラナ,char_528]
Ahaha, it's okay, it's okay!
Of course I understand.
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Good! Lana, what's Panis' name?
I didn't forget!
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][ラナ,char_528]
Hahahaha, that's not true!
I'll never forget my friend's name!
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah! But Panis doesn't know much about Lana...
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][ラナ,char_528]
fault? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah.
Where did Lana come from?
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][ラナ,char_528]
I'm from the mainland.
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Rather than coming, it's more like coming and going.
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][パニス,char_002 Panis]
why?
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][ラナ,char_528]
Because I'm in business.
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Showby?
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][ラナ,char_528]
Ahaha. I guess I have to explain it from there.
I want things that can't be found on this island.
They transport it by ship from the mainland and sell it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][ラナ,char_528]
Now, let's take a look at what can only be found on this island.
Take it back to the continent and sell it there.
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hmm...
The island and Tairiku...
Um, um...uh...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][ラナ,char_528]
Oops? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah……
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][ラナ,char_528]
I see. If you could leave me something,
That means I'll exchange it for something else.
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Is that so?
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][ラナ,char_528]
You are right!
Why are you so worried about me?
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][フリード,char_001 Fried]
You've been in this business for quite some time, right?
I've been coming to the island since I was little.
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][ラナ,char_528]
That's right. I guess I've been doing this for longer than your lifetime.
The people who live on this island
Almost all of them are good at it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Thanks to Lana carrying various supplies,
Even we who are on this island far away,
You can get things from the continent.
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][ラナ,char_528]
I shouldn't say this, but this island is isolated in the ocean,
Other ships, other than pirate ships, don't come very close.
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][パニス,char_002 Panis]
That's great, Lana!
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][ラナ,char_528]
Ahaha. I don't think it's particularly great though.
I just do business because I love it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But traveling the world like Lana,
Isn't it rare to find an elf doing business?
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][ラナ,char_528]
Well, elves aren't very sociable.
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Because only Lana and my sisters know,
I don't really feel it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][ラナ,char_528]
Ahahahaha! Maybe so!
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Well then, let's go now.
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Bye-bye, Lana!
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][ラナ,char_528]
Bye bye!
If you have free time, please come and visit us again!
Exchanges and trades are also welcome!
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hi Lana!
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][ラナ,char_528]
Oh, Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][パニス,char_002 Panis]
There's Panis too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][ラナ,char_528]
Hehehe.
Panis is welcome too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hey, give me something!
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][ラナ,char_528]
eh?
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Lana has all kinds of things from the continent, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][ラナ,char_528]
Haha... Geez, it's a little bit now.
I don't have anything that I can give you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Can't you give it to Panis?
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's not true, Panis. Lana to sell at the store
She just has things.
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hmm, that's right.
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][ラナ,char_528]
sorry.
I wish I could give you an apple as a gift.
All of them have just been sold.
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][フリード,char_001 Fried]
never mind. What kind of things do you sell outside the island?
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][ラナ,char_528]
anything. If there is something that someone wants,
I go everywhere to buy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Huh, that sounds like a lot of trouble.
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][ラナ,char_528]
No. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][フリード,char_001 Fried]
How did you get started?
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][ラナ,char_528]
I've been interested in it for a long time.
Things are bought and sold through money,
The way the world goes around.
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][ラナ,char_528]
If there is something I want, I can look for it myself,
To give it to someone who has it,
It was normal in the elf forest.
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][ラナ,char_528]
When you go there, you can get what you want through money.
Trading “business” is very convenient.
Don't you think it's a cool mechanism?
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I've never thought about it that way...
I wonder if that's true?
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][ラナ,char_528]
Business is very deep.
I think whoever thought of it first is really great.
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][フリード,char_001 Fried]
They sell all sorts of things for everyone.
Lana is great too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][ラナ,char_528]
I'm just doing business because I enjoy it,
When I get praised like that,
It's kind of embarrassing.
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][ラナ,char_528]
Well, before I could do business like this,
It took quite a while though.
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is that so?
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][ラナ,char_528]
It was rough at first.
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][ラナ,char_528]
``Don't underestimate business''
``You can't do business with your discerning eye.''
Have you often been scolded by your friends?
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][ラナ,char_528]
So I stuck with people who were doing business for a while,
I also did some training.
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][ラナ,char_528]
Thanks to you, I was able to travel around the world and expand my horizons.
I also found an opportunity to start "trading".
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][ラナ,char_528]
If you are also interested in business,
I'm always available for advice.
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hmm, I guess I'm not that interested.
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][ラナ,char_528]
yes? Freed is sure to be a good trader.
Because I think you can!
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][パニス,char_002 Panis]
What about panis?
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][ラナ,char_528]
Hehehe. Panis, of course.
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Lana, you really like business...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hi Lana!
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][ラナ,char_528]
Freed! Panis seems to be doing well too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hello Lana! Hey, can I ask you something?
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][ラナ,char_528]
What?
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hey, what is Koeki?
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][ラナ,char_528]
That's a sudden difficult question...
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I forgot to ask about it the other day.
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][ラナ,char_528]
let me see……
Trade is something that crosses countries and oceans.
I guess it's a big business thing.
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][ラナ,char_528]
...Did you understand from the explanation just now?
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah!
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Can I ask you one thing too?
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][ラナ,char_528]
what?
------------------------------------------------
[00000083][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Among all the various businesses, Lana
Have you thought about trading?
------------------------------------------------
[00000084][ラナ,char_528]
Well, I guess it's because the scale of the business is large.
Above all, I wanted to see the world,
Doing business in one country or city didn't make sense to me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000085][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But isn't it difficult to go out of your way to go far?
------------------------------------------------
[00000086][ラナ,char_528]
It's hard work, but it's so rewarding.
------------------------------------------------
[00000087][ラナ,char_528]
For example, even when it comes to an apple, it depends on the region where it is harvested.
There are many different types and different tastes,
People have different tastes, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000088][ラナ,char_528]
By connecting that, everyone around the world
When you think about being able to taste the apple that tastes the best,
Isn't it amazing?
------------------------------------------------
[00000089][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I see, that's certainly amazing!
------------------------------------------------
[00000090][ラナ,char_528]
Besides, the world is big.
There's even a new type of apple that no one knows about yet.
There might be, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000091][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Is there!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000092][ラナ,char_528]
I don't understand that either, so I can't fit into one country.
I travel around the world doing business.
------------------------------------------------
[00000093][フリード,char_001 Fried]
The scale is really big!
------------------------------------------------
[00000094][ラナ,char_528]
What's even more interesting is that even if they are exactly the same,
The value varies depending on the time of year and the land involved.
------------------------------------------------
[00000095][ラナ,char_528]
Things that have no value in a certain place,
It may even sell for a higher price elsewhere.
Therefore, the more I trade, the more reliable my eyes become.
------------------------------------------------
[00000096][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Lana looks like a lot of fun.
------------------------------------------------
[00000097][ラナ,char_528]
Yeah! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000098][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But Lana told me I don't have much business.
I don't feel it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000099][ラナ,char_528]
Ahaha!
I'm not in business for the purpose of making money.
------------------------------------------------
[00000100][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Eh!?
Isn't business something you do to make money?
------------------------------------------------
[00000101][ラナ,char_528]
I'm different.
To begin with, I've never had trouble with money.
------------------------------------------------
[00000102][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is Lana's family rich?
------------------------------------------------
[00000103][ラナ,char_528]
Do you mean rich?
We're royalty, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000104][フリード,char_001 Fried]
……picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000105][ラナ,char_528]
Well, maybe that's not the reason.
See, I said it earlier, right?　Elf was originally
I don't really care about money.
------------------------------------------------
[00000106][ラナ,char_528]
Even if you don't have money,
I guess I can get by somehow.
Is that why you're able to do business purely for fun?
------------------------------------------------
[00000107][フリード,char_001 Fried]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000108][ラナ,char_528]
...Freed? what happened?
------------------------------------------------
[00000109][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (I feel like someone just said something amazing...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000110][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hey Lana.
------------------------------------------------
[00000111][ラナ,char_528]
Oh, Freed, Panis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000112][フリード,char_001 Fried]
The other day, you said that Lana was royalty...
you don't say?
------------------------------------------------
[00000113][ラナ,char_528]
picture? It's gone...
------------------------------------------------
[00000114][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Lana, are you really a princess?
------------------------------------------------
[00000115][ラナ,char_528]
……Yeah. But keep this a secret! please!
------------------------------------------------
[00000116][ラナ,char_528]
I wouldn't say it in lieu of that, but
Just for today, I'll answer anything special!
------------------------------------------------
[00000117][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah, I understand.
So, what is the name of Lana's country?
------------------------------------------------
[00000118][ラナ,char_528]
It's a country called Fontina.
------------------------------------------------
[00000119][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Where is it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000120][ラナ,char_528]
All the way across the continent.
It's a little old-fashioned in some places, but
It's a wonderful country full of greenery.
------------------------------------------------
[00000121][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But...the princess left the country,
Is it okay to trade?
------------------------------------------------
[00000122][ラナ,char_528]
Even if I'm not there, I have an excellent sister, so it's okay!
------------------------------------------------
[00000123][ラナ,char_528]
I'm really proud of my little sister!
Because that child is here,
I can leave the country with peace of mind.
------------------------------------------------
[00000124][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Sister...it's tough...
------------------------------------------------
[00000125][ラナ,char_528]
Ah...of course, if it's a big deal for the country,
I'm also helping out with a lot of things!
------------------------------------------------
[00000126][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Will Lana ever go back there?
------------------------------------------------
[00000127][ラナ,char_528]
picture? Well, I have to go back someday.
I think so, but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000128][ラナ,char_528]
There are still many countries with which we do not trade,
Right now, I just want to travel more and more around the world.
Is that what it feels like?
------------------------------------------------
[00000129][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Are you going to Tooku?
------------------------------------------------
[00000130][ラナ,char_528]
You're confused, aren't you? I like this island now,
It's fun just to go back and forth between here and the continent, but
Expanding your horizons is even more fun!
------------------------------------------------
[00000131][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Lana is sure to explore a world that we don't know about.
I guess you know a lot.
------------------------------------------------
[00000132][ラナ,char_528]
When you live for a long time, many things happen.
I studied business, but sometimes...
I once fought to save the world...
------------------------------------------------
[00000133][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is that so!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000134][ラナ,char_528]
that's right?
Even though I look like this, I am a user of the divine bow!
------------------------------------------------
[00000135][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Shinkyu?
------------------------------------------------
[00000136][ラナ,char_528]
Well, that's a great bow.
It's an important thing that I received from my master.
That's why I'm still trying to keep up my training.
------------------------------------------------
[00000137][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's amazing.
I'd like to see Lana's bow skills.
------------------------------------------------
[00000138][ラナ,char_528]
If I have a chance. Hehe, that’s surprising!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000139][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (That must be cool, Lana shooting a bow...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000140][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hi Lana!
------------------------------------------------
[00000141][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Runner! It's here!
------------------------------------------------
[00000142][ラナ,char_528]
Welcome, both of you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000143][ラナ,char_528]
Today to you,
I wanted to thank you again.
------------------------------------------------
[00000144][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Thank you? about what?
------------------------------------------------
[00000145][ラナ,char_528]
The world was saved thanks to you!
thank you! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000146][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Lana...
------------------------------------------------
[00000147][ラナ,char_528]
The reason everyone is smiling, and the reason I can continue trading,
It's all thanks to Freed and Panis!
------------------------------------------------
[00000148][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Lana also protected this island.
------------------------------------------------
[00000149][ラナ,char_528]
Eh, me?
------------------------------------------------
[00000150][フリード,char_001 Fried]
that's right. You were protecting the place you went home to, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000151][ラナ,char_528]
Well, that's all I can do.
And with Bacchus and Cherubim.
It looks like the pirates were working hard too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000152][ラナ,char_528]
anyway!
You guys saved this world!
All you have to do is be proud and express your gratitude!
------------------------------------------------
[00000153][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hahaha. I wonder if that's true?
------------------------------------------------
[00000154][ラナ,char_528]
However, the depth of this island's bosom is bottomless.
We can't ignore the dangers of another world.
------------------------------------------------
[00000155][ラナ,char_528]
It was the same when I came.
They accepted me easily and let me trade with them.
------------------------------------------------
[00000156][ラナ,char_528]
I still bring it out sometimes, but
In the beginning, I was causing a lot of damage to the people on the island.
But, even though he was strict, he watched over me warmly...
------------------------------------------------
[00000157][フリード,char_001 Fried]
This island is like one big family.
------------------------------------------------
[00000158][ラナ,char_528]
Everyone supports each other and helps each other.
I think it's a wonderful relationship.
------------------------------------------------
[00000159][ラナ,char_528]
I'm sure for you,
Including other worlds,
Everything in this world is family, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000160][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yes, I'm sure so.
------------------------------------------------
[00000161][ラナ,char_528]
I feel kind of jealous.
------------------------------------------------
[00000162][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Why are you talking like a normal person?
------------------------------------------------
[00000163][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Lana is family too, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000164][ラナ,char_528]
eh?
------------------------------------------------
[00000165][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Lana is also an important family member.
------------------------------------------------
[00000166][ラナ,char_528]
……thank you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000167][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Thank you for your continued support, Lana!
------------------------------------------------
[00000168][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Give me something delicious!
------------------------------------------------
[00000169][ラナ,char_528]
Yeah!
We'll have a boat full of them, so please look forward to it!
------------------------------------------------
