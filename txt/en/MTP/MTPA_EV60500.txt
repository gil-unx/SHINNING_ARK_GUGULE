[00000000][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
At that time, thanks to my sister, I was saved.
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Oh, I don't remember! I don't remember!
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It must have been because my sister was half asleep and kicked me!
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Phew...! Giggle...
Ah...F-Freed, I'm sorry.
I suddenly remembered Freed's childhood.
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hey, Freed, do you remember?
Freed fell into the gap between the bed and the wall...
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hehe, I'm laughing like this now,
I was really surprised at that time.
I'm glad you are fine……
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Freed. Now you're talking about Panis.
Please take care of yourself.
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
yes……? Even though it was such a big deal back then, I feel lonely...
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What...! "What are you saying all of a sudden?"
Are you trying to falsely implicate me?
I have no recollection of doing that at all!
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...Freed, don't you remember?
...If that's the case, I can't help it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
My dream is,
Thinking of a new recipe for delicious bread,
It's about making a lot of people happy!
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...So, is it a bit free?
What are those eyes!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Panis may be the only survivor.
I wonder what it all means...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hey, Freed?
Go to Kilmaria-san,
Would you like to hear more details?
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
The attack that makes the cave look like that...
Just thinking about it gives me chills...
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That girl named Cherubim,
He is expressionless and silent,
I don't know what you're thinking.
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
In some ways, she's scarier than Viola.
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
My uncle and aunt are my parents now.
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Sometimes I think so.
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I don't feel lonely because everyone in the village is here.
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Like Panis, Freed also
He doesn't remember his real parents...
Freed, would you like to meet his birth parents?
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
……Really.
I heard something boring. Forget it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Really. Any clues about your family,
It would be nice if there was one...
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That may be true, but...
What is it like to feel lonely and be interested in your past?
Isn't that another issue?
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
...Freed, don't push yourself too hard, okay?
If you lie to yourself, it will only make things worse.
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
...Ah, that's fine.
You don't have to answer if you don't want to.
I'm sorry, Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Our ship "Blue Noah"...
All in all, this is a really nice ship.
Freed, you think so too, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Could this island itself be the ``ark'' of an ancient civilization?
That's something I can't even imagine...
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
The ancient war is
How large was it...?
My head can't keep up...
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That Cherub guy is quite dangerous.
Even this time, I wasn't able to completely destroy it.
I can't let my guard down yet...
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
That's not true, Adam is helpful.
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I'll leave that to Kilmaria-san.
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
So why not check it out yourself?
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
My database is corrupted, so
Unable to refer to data regarding ruins satisfactorily,
I feel like I'm causing trouble for everyone.
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Should we take measures?
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
is that so. So, while I continue to collect data,
We will continue to assist with village reconstruction work and agricultural work.
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I think there is a problem with leaving everything to you.
This is what humans say, "I'm sorry."
Is it a feeling...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Anyway, from now on, I'll help Kill Maria.
Do it proactively.
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
You're right. From now on, I will use my free time to
I'll try to investigate on my own.
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I don't have much interest in Mr. Freed.
It seems like it was a story.
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
while growing plants
The operations around the thought program become stable.
It seems that agriculture is suitable for me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
If I am truly a product of an ancient civilization,
The truth should be written in the memory device.
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I would like to refer to the data somehow...
very sorry. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
A weapon with enough power to cut through the earth...
What is the ancient war that used it?
How spectacular was it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
...Maybe even me,
Maybe he was watching the scene.
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Am I an ancient weapon?
If you think about that, the operation will become unstable...
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
However, with your encouragement,
I can somehow recover. thank you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
If it's okay with me, I'll lend you my strength any time.
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Don't push yourself too hard.
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
It's tough.
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
However, there is a lot to explore about this island.
There are mountains of them.
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Of course it's rewarding, but
One body is not enough...
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
thank you!
However, once you are spoiled, you will be able to keep slipping away endlessly.
I feel like I'm going to rely on Mr. Freed...
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Anyway, it's just me now
I will try as much as I can!
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yeah, I'll be careful.
However, according to my justice
As long as you take action, you won't harm your body.
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Thank you for your concern!
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
What I did was
I ended up saying something that sounded like whining...
sorry……
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
……sorry.
There's no point in saying things like that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I'm not good at ships...
In fact, I get drunk easily.
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Maybe because of that,
I can't seem to get used to naval battles...
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Ancient people in the “Ark”…! And then...!
Oh, how exciting!
I can't stop researching! It won't stop!
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I think that's probably a trace of war...
It is possible that this island was once damaged by war.
I can't deny it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Me too, Adam.
He wants to believe that he is not a weapon.
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
However, to conclude,
There is still a lack of research...
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
The fact that it disappears during high tide in the evening means that
Undersea ruins that can only be visited at low tide in the evening,
It's the opposite pattern.
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
However, the tides vary depending on the topography, climate, and day.
I never thought it would change so much! Although I was learning,
It's really interesting to see it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
This is what's helping me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
you're welcome.
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I do not think so?
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Solving various mysteries little by little,
It's exciting to feel like we're getting to the core of the story.
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
To the "power" I'm looking for
I feel like it's getting closer...
It was really great working with you guys.
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I hope we can continue to have a good relationship going forward.
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I'll do my best too, so please support me too!
I'm looking forward to it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Oh, don't forget to help me, okay?
It's just a trade of equals, give and take.
Don't get carried away, okay? Good?
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Well, let's keep up the good work!
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
……What.
You don't seem to be very grateful.
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I feel like an idiot because I was just having fun by myself...
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
……fault? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hey, Adam's facial expressions have changed lately.
I'm starting to understand!
This is just me, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
……picture? That's right...it's kind of a shame.
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
But does this mean I'm getting used to it too?
Aran, sister, I'm so happy♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
"Ark" and the ancients...
For these two to reach "power"
Seems like an important clue.
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
There are still many things I don't understand,
I feel like we're getting a little closer to the core.
------------------------------------------------
[00000083][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That cave wall looks like it's been burnt out...
What kind of power can I use to do such a thing?
I can't even imagine...
------------------------------------------------
[00000084][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Long ago, on this island,
A power beyond our imagination,
It seems like it existed...
------------------------------------------------
[00000085][ガルゼー,char_501]
Hey Panis!
Panis-chan is doing well today too...
Soncho is happy too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000086][ガルゼー,char_501]
The reconstruction work has largely been completed,
All that was left was to arrange the inside of each house...
No, it really took this long.
------------------------------------------------
[00000087][ガルゼー,char_501]
Freed and the others worked really hard.
I'll thank you again. thank you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000088][ガルゼー,char_501]
Of course I'm happy that the village has been restored, but
The bathroom in my house is back to normal.
I'm really happy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000089][ガルゼー,char_501]
While relaxing in the bath for the first time in a while,
Let's think about the future...
Yes, it would be nice to have a festival on this occasion...
------------------------------------------------
[00000090][ジム,char_502]
Okay? Don't think you're the only ones protecting the village?
Even we vigilantes are fighting!
------------------------------------------------
[00000091][ジム,char_502]
You guys were just investigating ruins,
You haven't cooperated in the village's reconstruction in the slightest!?
Let me help you once in a while!
------------------------------------------------
[00000092][マイア,char_503]
Peace is best above all else.
Panis and her children are playing together happily
That's what I think from the bottom of my heart as I look at this heart-warming scene.
------------------------------------------------
[00000093][マイア,char_503]
A lot has happened, but the village will soon be restored.
I'm really glad it seems to have calmed down.
In particular, Panis-chan helped me a lot.
------------------------------------------------
[00000094][マイア,char_503]
...It seems like Panis-chan has a lot going on,
That child is already a worthy member of the village.
Let's all protect Panis-chan.
------------------------------------------------
[00000095][アリーゼ,char_504]
There are as many monsters as there are stars on this island.
Even if you get rid of them, they will come back again.
------------------------------------------------
[00000096][アリーゼ,char_504]
Because requests for subjugation never end,
Please keep accepting it!
I asked for it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000097][アリーゼ,char_504]
The village is completely back to normal!
Is the reconstruction work finally coming to an end?
------------------------------------------------
[00000098][アリーゼ,char_504]
Ah, but things at home aren't in order yet.
The bath in the village chief's house is still broken.
------------------------------------------------
[00000099][アリーゼ,char_504]
Finally, my father has returned.
I want the adventure to end now.
I want you to be quiet and concentrate on your work at the store...
------------------------------------------------
[00000100][ダイアナ,char_505]
Hey, how is my shop...?
More unusual items...
Should I leave it there...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000101][ダイアナ,char_505]
picture……? Yes...then you can rest assured...hehehehehe...
------------------------------------------------
[00000102][ダイアナ,char_505]
Panis is an ancient person...?
I wonder what kind of alcohol the ancient people drank...
I'm interested...hehehehehe...
------------------------------------------------
[00000103][ドルトン,char_506]
Don't you want better weapons soon?
Then come to me!
My weapons are still far from that!
------------------------------------------------
[00000104][ドルトン,char_506]
The commotion has subsided, and the village has regained its calm.
That's fine, but don't be too calm.
My weapons won't sell anymore...
------------------------------------------------
[00000105][ドルトン,char_506]
...What are you looking at strangely?
Even I make jokes about it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000106][ロラン,char_507]
Freed, do you know?
The people of Gikaidan are quite monsters.
Pirates are open to you, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000107][ロラン,char_507]
Well, I'll leave it up to Freed and the others.
I'm getting stronger quickly,
Fight against monsters!
------------------------------------------------
[00000108][カール,char_508]
Hey Panis, do you like me?
As for me...
------------------------------------------------
[00000109][カール,char_508]
I love Panis so much!
------------------------------------------------
[00000110][メリー,char_509]
We can't do it now, but someday we'll be together.
------------------------------------------------
[00000111][メリー,char_509]
I hope you're a good girl and stay at home.
------------------------------------------------
[00000112][メリー,char_509]
It's not a game.
------------------------------------------------
[00000113][メリー,char_509]
Freed is with everyone
Are you exploring everywhere?
That's great...I want to go too...
------------------------------------------------
[00000114][メリー,char_509]
Are you angry? I'm sure!
Don't forget!
------------------------------------------------
[00000115][メリー,char_509]
It's not good after all...
Well then, I want everyone to be able to explore freely.
You're so excited!
------------------------------------------------
[00000116][メリー,char_509]
I know!
That's why I wanted to help too...
------------------------------------------------
[00000117][メリー,char_509]
...After all, it's no good?
------------------------------------------------
[00000118][メリー,char_509]
Kill Maria isn't looking straight ahead when walking, right?
Because I'm always walking while reading a big book!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000119][ハンス,char_510]
Even if Alise stops me or cries, I'm going!
Because I'm an adventurer!
The ruins are calling me!
------------------------------------------------
[00000120][ハンス,char_510]
I'm not a monster, I'm not a fart,
Alise scolded me harshly,
She's completely gone.
------------------------------------------------
[00000121][ハンス,char_510]
That child who is always calm,
I didn't expect him to be so angry...
------------------------------------------------
[00000122][ハンス,char_510]
Alise's one...
He's starting to look more and more like him...
------------------------------------------------
[00000123][ボリス,char_511]
If you are having trouble or have a hard time,
Come to this cove.
------------------------------------------------
[00000124][ボリス,char_511]
While watching the sun set on the horizon,
Shout out loud to the sea.
All your petty worries will be blown away.
------------------------------------------------
[00000125][ボリス,char_511]
What?
Is Panis-chan a survivor of the ancients?
------------------------------------------------
[00000126][ボリス,char_511]
...So, Panis-chan is older than me?
Do I have to call you Mr. Panis?
------------------------------------------------
[00000127][デボラ,char_512]
Panis-chan, it would be nice if you could help me.
I'll protect Freed as well, okay?
That's right, would you both like some sweets?
------------------------------------------------
[00000128][デボラ,char_512]
Panis-chan, it must have been tough...
Thinking that Grandma is the real Grandma,
It's okay to be spoiled, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000129][デボラ,char_512]
Freed.
Please take good care of Panis-chan.
nice?
------------------------------------------------
[00000130][ハイラム,char_513]
But isn't it a great discovery?
------------------------------------------------
[00000131][ハイラム,char_513]
I was surprised too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000132][ハイラム,char_513]
My uncle is a laid-back person...
------------------------------------------------
[00000133][ハイラム,char_513]
“Ancient people” in “Ark”…?
Various stories came out one after another,
I feel like my eyes are spinning somehow.
------------------------------------------------
[00000134][ハイラム,char_513]
That's certainly true.
I can't believe that Freed and his team found out that through their investigation.
It's an amazing story when you think about it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000135][ハイラム,char_513]
I guess so.
Although I always saw the ruins,
There was such a secret on this island...
------------------------------------------------
[00000136][ハイラム,char_513]
It's not like my uncle is taking it easy.
It's just that the people around me and other people are moving too fast.
Especially my mother...
------------------------------------------------
[00000137][ハイラム,char_513]
...So, Freed!
Don't let me say anything that will make Rian angry!
------------------------------------------------
[00000138][ハイラム,char_513]
Oh? What's wrong, Freed?
Are you dizzy too?
------------------------------------------------
[00000139][ハイラム,char_513]
Who taught Shannon how to bake bread?
It's Rian.
------------------------------------------------
[00000140][ハイラム,char_513]
Leanne is also good at coming up with new recipes.
Bread that will make you feel very happy,
He created several.
------------------------------------------------
[00000141][ハイラム,char_513]
But why is Shannon's new work...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000142][ハイラム,char_513]
Panis may be an ancient person,
It doesn't matter.
------------------------------------------------
[00000143][ハイラム,char_513]
For me, Panis is
Just like Freed, Shannon, and Rian.
There's nothing wrong with being an important family member.
------------------------------------------------
[00000144][リアン,char_514]
Chapter 5: Daytime conversation
------------------------------------------------
[00000145][リアン,char_514]
Conversations and questions related to likeability
------------------------------------------------
[00000146][リアン,char_514]
Reaction when favorability increases
------------------------------------------------
[00000147][リアン,char_514]
Reaction when favorability remains the same
------------------------------------------------
[00000148][リアン,char_514]
Reaction when favorability drops
------------------------------------------------
[00000149][リアン,char_514]
Reactions to questions when time is up
------------------------------------------------
[00000150][リアン,char_514]
When you eat Hiram's vegetables,
It's very refreshing. That person,
We take care of each and every vegetable.
------------------------------------------------
[00000151][リアン,char_514]
Adam also understands this and explains how to make Hiram.
It seems like he's setting me up as a role model.
Adam's vegetables are also very delicious.
------------------------------------------------
[00000152][リアン,char_514]
Ancient people or something.
I don't really understand difficult topics...
Panis is panis, nothing will change.
------------------------------------------------
[00000153][リアン,char_514]
thank you as always.
If only there were as many hairs as that of the giant horned mojara,
You can weave a lot of cloth.
------------------------------------------------
[00000154][ダリオ,char_515]
Yes, I'm counting on you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000155][ダリオ,char_515]
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000156][ダリオ,char_515]
I'm a little worried...
------------------------------------------------

Freed and the others seem to be having a lot of trouble as well.
Well, leave the guarding of the village to me!
------------------------------------------------
[00000158][ダリオ,char_515]
Hehehe, I'm glad to hear that!
Freed, let's do our best together!
------------------------------------------------
[00000159][ダリオ,char_515]
What are you talking about?
Please rely on us a little too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000160][ダリオ,char_515]
Are you worried...?
Does that mean we are unreliable...?
Well, actually, I'm no match for you...
------------------------------------------------
[00000161][ダリオ,char_515]
Please answer me something, Freed...
------------------------------------------------
[00000162][ダリオ,char_515]
Jim is also a member of the vigilante group.
Moreover, he is supposed to be the leader.
------------------------------------------------
[00000163][ダリオ,char_515]
Well, actually, it doesn't really have anything to do with military strength, but
He thinks about the village in his own way.
I think Freed understands.
------------------------------------------------
[00000164][ダリオ,char_515]
Panis is a survivor of the ancients,
This island is said to be an ancient ark.
------------------------------------------------
[00000165][ダリオ,char_515]
...Honestly, I don't understand why,
I don't understand it at all.
------------------------------------------------
[00000166][ミルコ,char_516]
Please rest assured, Lana and Velvet!
While the two of you are in this cove,
This is how we will continue to protect peace!
------------------------------------------------
[00000167][ミルコ,char_516]
I wish I could say that to myself.
------------------------------------------------
[00000168][ミルコ,char_516]
Recently, that big monster
They no longer appear near the village,
I feel a little more at ease now!
------------------------------------------------
[00000169][ミルコ,char_516]
But you know?
Freed and the others are chasing him back somewhere else, right?
Thank you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000170][ロドリゴ,char_517]
Thanks to the efforts of Freed and Zynga,
We, the vigilantes, are becoming less and less visible.
Well, as long as the village is peaceful, it doesn't matter.
------------------------------------------------
[00000171][ロドリゴ,char_517]
But that doesn't mean I can relax.
Monsters and pirates suddenly attack,
Don't let your guard down!
------------------------------------------------
[00000172][ロドリゴ,char_517]
Enfield civilization...
Come to think of it, I guess I learned it at school when I was a kid...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000173][ダニエル,char_518]
Looking at Peter's work,
It reminds me of my youth.
I was desperate back then...
------------------------------------------------
[00000174][ダニエル,char_518]
Well, Peter is still not a full-fledged man,
I have to try harder.
------------------------------------------------
[00000175][ダニエル,char_518]
This island is called the ark.
The farm animals too
Maybe it's some kind of special variety?
------------------------------------------------
[00000176][ブレンダ,char_519]
When I talked to Daniel recently,
I watched Peter work from behind a tree.
I'm just staring at it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000177][ブレンダ,char_519]
So I was just nodding my head.
That's already weird...!
That person really is an idiot.
------------------------------------------------
[00000178][ブレンダ,char_519]
But that kind of thing
That's a good thing about Daniel.
------------------------------------------------
[00000179][ブレンダ,char_519]
Panis-chan's parents are no longer here...
It must be tough, but always smile...
------------------------------------------------
[00000180][ブレンダ,char_519]
……Yeah.
She's already part of the village family.
I can't let you feel sad.
------------------------------------------------
[00000181][ピーター,char_520]
If so, that's interesting.
------------------------------------------------
[00000182][ピーター,char_520]
The name ``Ark'' hasn't been decided yet.
------------------------------------------------
[00000183][ピーター,char_520]
Why are you always talking about sheep?
------------------------------------------------
[00000184][ピーター,char_520]
Is this island the “Ark”?
Well, let's take a closer look at this island.
Do you know anything about ancient times?
------------------------------------------------
[00000185][ピーター,char_520]
For example, what did ancient sheep look like?
What color was his hair?
------------------------------------------------
[00000186][ピーター,char_520]
That's right...!
It's kind of exciting when I think about it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000187][ピーター,char_520]
Yeah, that's true though.
But if so, wouldn't it be fun?
So many things!
------------------------------------------------
[00000188][ピーター,char_520]
picture……?
That's because I like sheep...
------------------------------------------------
[00000189][ピーター,char_520]
...I'm sorry, Freed.
It's always about animals.
Maybe you were bored?
------------------------------------------------
[00000190][ピーター,char_520]
I'm sure it has very fluffy fur and produces a lot of milk.
I guess it was that kind of sheep...
------------------------------------------------
[00000191][ピーター,char_520]
My father is scary when he gets angry, but
He's always thinking about me.
I think he's a little too worried though...
------------------------------------------------
[00000192][ピーター,char_520]
Did that big guy show up in the ruins this time?
It was tough...
Anyway, I'm glad everyone is safe.
------------------------------------------------
[00000193][ラナ,char_528]
There were lots of unusual murals and stone statues.
------------------------------------------------
[00000194][ラナ,char_528]
There were a lot of dangerous things.
------------------------------------------------
[00000195][ラナ,char_528]
There was nothing for sale.
------------------------------------------------
[00000196][ラナ,char_528]
You guys, ruins here and there
Looks like you're doing some research.
copper? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000197][ラナ,char_528]
Hmm, that's right.
I guess I can't sell it, but
I'm interested.
------------------------------------------------
[00000198][ラナ,char_528]
Shall I go see it too?
------------------------------------------------
[00000199][ラナ,char_528]
Is it something dangerous?
You can't put that on a ship.
------------------------------------------------
[00000200][ラナ,char_528]
I didn't ask this to sell anything!
Then it's like I...
It's like you're only thinking about business!
------------------------------------------------
[00000201][ラナ,char_528]
what? I am very curious……
I'll go there next time too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000202][ラナ,char_528]
Being a pirate might be surprisingly fun.
Explore unknown waters, gather friends...
------------------------------------------------
[00000203][ラナ,char_528]
But I still can't beat the charm of business!
------------------------------------------------
[00000204][ラナ,char_528]
The village has also been rebuilt to a great extent!
Do you feel like things will be back to normal in just one more step?
------------------------------------------------
[00000205][ラナ,char_528]
If you need anything, please call me anytime.
Even if you don't have it now,
I'll buy most things for you.
------------------------------------------------
