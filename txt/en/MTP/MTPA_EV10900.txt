[00000000][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Freed, just in the right place.
I want to ask a favor of you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][フリード,char_001 Fried]
OK. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
I'd like to help you,
I would like to know about your abilities.
You see, I often use it during battles...
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Time for battle?
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Oh, isn't that it?
Look, I can see several Freeds...
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Yes, that.
How did you acquire that ability?
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][鋼刃丸,char_531]
Pipi~?
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Ah! I was really curious about that ability...
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Certainly, that was used,
The situation of the war was often turned upside down.
I'm curious as to how he learned it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, no matter how you ask me...
By the time I realized it, I was already able to use it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That's right, ever since Freed was little,
Me and everyone in the village,
I guess that power has helped me a lot.
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I see... So, what are innate abilities?
Is that what you mean?
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Probably so.
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Hmm...I see.
After all...
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What do you mean after all?
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
When ancient civilizations flourished,
Apparently there was someone who could use this kind of ability.
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
This island has a strange connection to ancient civilizations.
I don't think it has anything to do with Freed's ability.
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I-I guess so...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
In ancient times, there was a person with abilities like Mr. Freed...
No such record exists in my memory.
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
This is also the first time I've heard of such a story.
Viola, you are very knowledgeable.
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I mean, how do you know?
Such a thing……
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
it is……
Hi・mi・tsu♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
...Oh my gosh.
However, there are certainly many traces of ancient times on this island.
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
When I looked into them, I found out about the boy's abilities.
Don't you know something?
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It looks interesting! Now I can use that ability!
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I don't know about that...
How could I do something like that too?
I'd like to know something.
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
If so, let's go find out.
There must be some ruins that haven't been explored yet.
Let's start from there.
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Ruins that haven't been investigated yet...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Is there such a thing?
What I did was
I didn't notice it at all...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Where on earth is it?
please tell me! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
But...why Viola-san?
Are you even aware of that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
That’s also true♪
This way, follow me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hey, there was a place like this on the island.
I didn't know at all...
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Me too. Well, it's an inconvenient place to come to,
There are no good fishing spots nearby.
Isn't it strange that you don't notice it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
caveat!Someone is approaching!
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Are you a monster!?
In that case, in the name of Justice, I will exorcise you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][バッカス,char_527]
You guys! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][ケルビム,char_529]
Intruder found! Intruder found!
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Moi!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Isn't it Bacchus?
What are you doing? At a place like this.
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][バッカス,char_527]
That's the line!
You are our hideout.
What are you doing!
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Your hideout!? This is it!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][バッカス,char_527]
that's right! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Mr. Viola...
What does this mean?
Is there some kind of mistake...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
No, it's not a mistake.
I never thought Bacchus would be there.
You know, Bacchus...
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][バッカス,char_527]
What the hell! What on earth is that for?
Ah... now you guys...
You came to attack my hideout!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
wrong.
We came to investigate the ruins.
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
That's right, in this cave where you hide out,
There are ruins of an ancient civilization.
I'd like you to investigate that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][バッカス,char_527]
Noisy! Such a blatant lie
I'm not the type of person who gets caught!
Deputy chief! I'll kick these guys out!
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][ケルビム,char_529]
But the captain.
They don't seem to have any intention of fighting.
Is it okay if I listen to your story?
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Good...
This person seems to be willing to listen to me...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][バッカス,char_527]
I'm sure they'll attack even if they don't have the will to do so!
It's okay, Deputy Chief!
These guys are trying to steal our dreams!
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][ケルビム,char_529]
dream……?
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][バッカス,char_527]
That's it! They're trying to destroy the strongest pirate group's hideout!
Are you going to just ignore it!? Vice-commander!
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][ケルビム,char_529]
That's...unforgivable!
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][ケルビム,char_529]
...I understand, my friend.
Let's fight together to protect the pride of pirates!
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Ah...I guess this person is no good either...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hmm...
It can't be helped, these guys!
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
So, follow the pirate's style,
Let's talk with swords!
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
...That's not to say.
We just came to find out.
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][バッカス,char_527]
Geez!If that's the case, why not say so from the beginning?
They're alarmist guys.
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][ケルビム,char_529]
Absolutely, Captain.
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][フリード,char_001 Fried]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
This kid became a friend, and the Bacchus Pirates also joined.
I think it's gotten a little better...
It’s not just that there are now two Tonchiki!
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
They say you call your friends...
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Let's put that matter aside for now.
First, we have to check out the ruins!
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That's right! You might find something interesting!
Look! You guys should help too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][バッカス,char_527]
Oh, oh...
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][ケルビム,char_529]
I got it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
I see……
This is interesting.
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yeah. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
A message remains on the wall.
It seems like it's some sort of write-up.
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Write it down?
Who the hell left it in a place like this?
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
What does it say?
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I will try to decipher it.
Please wait.
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Adam, can you do it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
yes. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
……Sorry I made you wait.
I was able to do it, albeit in fragments.
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It's quite early, isn't it!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Yeah. I used it, but the expression, word selection, etc.
Because they had a lot in common.
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Does that mean it was written by the same person?
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
It seems that it is.
Now, let's output the analyzed part as audio.
------------------------------------------------
[00000083][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000Those who read the records I wrote,
Will he really show up? I feel so uneasy.
Still, I have to leave it for posterity.
------------------------------------------------
[00000084][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000Hopefully,
I hope my record doesn't catch anyone's attention...
------------------------------------------------
[00000085][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
what's this? In some way, I was prepared to die...
It's like it was written at the time of destruction...
------------------------------------------------
[00000086][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
……yes.
In fact, it appears to have been written at the time of destruction.
------------------------------------------------
[00000087][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
You mean during the ancient war?
------------------------------------------------
[00000088][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
It seems so. Continue audio output.
------------------------------------------------
[00000089][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000We moved to this island because we were fed up with civilization.
To be involved in a war like this,
How ironic.
------------------------------------------------
[00000090][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000But that's why,
I have to write it down.
About the destruction and tragedy that this war brought.
------------------------------------------------
[00000091][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Unfortunately, this post ends here.
------------------------------------------------
[00000092][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
At the time of war with another world,
There was someone who lived on this island...
------------------------------------------------
[00000093][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Records of the time left by people caught up in the war...
This is very interesting...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000094][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
No, it's not interesting,
Isn't this the most valuable historical testimony?
I want to read it! It's me! Continuation of this!
------------------------------------------------
[00000095][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
If you left this note,
The person who left the inscription that has been in the ruins until now,
It's the same person, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000096][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
yes. I think you can say that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000097][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
...That means that if we re-investigate the ruins,
You might find more notes,
Isn't that what you mean?
------------------------------------------------
[00000098][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
From this point of view, until now,
Of course I didn't do any research...
This requires a thorough investigation!
------------------------------------------------
[00000099][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I’m curious too!
The owner of this note is probably more than just a record.
I might be leaving something behind!
------------------------------------------------
[00000100][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I don't know what will come out...
Regarding my future territory,
I'd like to know more about it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000101][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It seems like everyone has a lot of ideas...
Yeah, I guess I should check it out after all.
Viola, could you lend me a hand?
------------------------------------------------
[00000102][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Yes, of course.
I was the one who proposed this investigation.
------------------------------------------------
[00000103][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Besides, I want to know too.
What happened on this island in the past?
------------------------------------------------
[00000104][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Freed!
Let's go investigate the ruins!
------------------------------------------------
[00000105][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Start with the ruins near the cove!
I'll do my best to do what I want...
------------------------------------------------
[00000106][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Not! Look for the ancients' notes!
------------------------------------------------
[00000107][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Did everyone find anything?
------------------------------------------------
[00000108][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
That being said, this place was previously
I have already investigated...
I don't think you'll find any omissions in the investigation?
------------------------------------------------
[00000109][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's true……
There doesn't seem to be anything here either.
------------------------------------------------
[00000110][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hey. Is this the wrong place...?
disappointing.
------------------------------------------------
[00000111][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000112][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Sister, what's wrong?
------------------------------------------------
[00000113][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I remembered the last time I came here.
When Panis approached the stone statue here,
Something strange happened, I thought.
------------------------------------------------
[00000114][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That's right. Suddenly an earthquake occurs,
Immediately after that, the red moon rose,
A monster attacks...
------------------------------------------------
[00000115][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
...This is not a stone statue.
------------------------------------------------
[00000116][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Isn't it a stone statue?
So what is it? this is.
------------------------------------------------
[00000117][鋼刃丸,char_531]
Pee?
------------------------------------------------
[00000118][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
This is an ancient weapon.
It has almost stopped functioning.
------------------------------------------------
[00000119][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Ancient weapon?　
Well then, the vice-commander at Bacchus's place, etc.
Is it like that iron boy over there?
------------------------------------------------
[00000120][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000121][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Oops, sorry.
I guess I was worried.
------------------------------------------------
[00000122][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
No, it's fine.
That's already...
------------------------------------------------
[00000123][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000124][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Anyway,
I have something to worry about...
------------------------------------------------
[00000125][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Weapons here include
Is there no more danger?
------------------------------------------------
[00000126][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
It's probably okay.
It's only alive with limited functionality.
Even when Panis touched it earlier, it didn't start, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000127][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
But when Panis touched me before,
Something strange happened?
------------------------------------------------
[00000128][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Maybe that was this child's final reaction...
I tried to activate it in response to the enemy Panis, but I couldn't.
In the end, it only stimulated Panis' trauma.
------------------------------------------------
[00000129][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Panis-san's trauma...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000130][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Yeah, probably.
And Panis unconsciously opens the door to another world...
------------------------------------------------
[00000131][フリード,char_001 Fried]
……I see.
Then, a red moon appeared and a scream from another world
It has flowed in...
------------------------------------------------
[00000132][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
...But, Viola.
Why do you know so much?
------------------------------------------------
[00000133][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
it is……
H-mi-tsu, yo...
------------------------------------------------
[00000134][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But to think that such a weapon was used...
The battle between the ancients and the aliens is
I wonder how intense it must have been...
------------------------------------------------
[00000135][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
That's right...
------------------------------------------------
[00000136][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000137][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Why don't you all go to the ice field ruins next?
------------------------------------------------
[00000138][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Although it is a ruin that I previously investigated,
I haven't been able to fully investigate every detail.
Because there is not...
------------------------------------------------
[00000139][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
There is still a possibility that there will be more undiscovered things.
I think there is enough!
------------------------------------------------
[00000140][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's right, let's go!
------------------------------------------------
[00000141][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Although there may be an oversight,
I am sure that I have done a thorough investigation,
If there's a new discovery, it's probably in the corner...
------------------------------------------------
[00000142][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
nothing?
------------------------------------------------
[00000143][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Did you find anything?
------------------------------------------------
[00000144][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It looks like there's something written in the corner of the wall.
Let Adam read it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000145][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I agree.
Adam, please!
------------------------------------------------
[00000146][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I got it. Start scanning...
------------------------------------------------
[00000147][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
However, the iron boy also has great skills.
I guess I have it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000148][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Eventually, I would like to serve as a translator for the imperial court.
Maybe I should consider it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000149][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Has completed. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000150][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000The war is becoming more and more intense.
A land covered in ice.
It's a distorted scene, unbecoming of a southern island.
------------------------------------------------
[00000151][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000 The distortion of civilization has also distorted the workings of nature.
What will happen to us from now on?
How much destruction can a foolish fight bring?
------------------------------------------------
[00000152][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000 I feel sorry for my newborn son.
Until this child grows up
Can we leave this island behind?
------------------------------------------------
[00000153][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
This too...
Was it written by the same person as the previous note?
------------------------------------------------
[00000154][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Judging from the handwriting, I think it's almost certain.
------------------------------------------------
[00000155][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
What do you mean...
After all, this topography is due to the effects of the war.
It was...
------------------------------------------------
[00000156][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
He said "son".
An innocent family gets caught up in the war,
You were making me feel bad...
------------------------------------------------
[00000157][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
That's right...
That's really sad...
------------------------------------------------
[00000158][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000159][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hey, look! How long will everyone be depressed?
For now, here is
So you found what you were looking for?
------------------------------------------------
[00000160][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yeah……
That's what it means.
------------------------------------------------
[00000161][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
In that case, why don't you change your mind and go home for today?
Also, where to check next
I have to think about it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000162][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
That's true too...
------------------------------------------------
[00000163][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That's right. Will you do that?
Let's pull up.
------------------------------------------------
[00000164][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Even Velvet was drawn to everyone,
Before I get bored...what?
------------------------------------------------
[00000165][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What! Ah, not me...
------------------------------------------------
[00000166][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hahaha, well, that's fine!
Don't be so pushy.
Now, let's go home!
------------------------------------------------
[00000167][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
So I...
ah!
------------------------------------------------
[00000168][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Hey, you guys.
Since then, I've been thinking about a lot of things.
------------------------------------------------
[00000169][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It is said that those ice fields are the scars of war.
Maybe the desert is like that too?
------------------------------------------------
[00000170][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It is strange that there is an ice field on a southern island,
This island is surrounded by the sea and receives a lot of rain.
There's no way you can do that in the desert either.
------------------------------------------------
[00000171][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I'm definitely curious...
Okay, let's go check it out!
------------------------------------------------
[00000172][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
The burnt walls of the cave,
If this desert is also the scar of war...
------------------------------------------------
[00000173][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
How violent were ancient wars?
It must have been tragic...
------------------------------------------------
[00000174][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
The power of ancient weapons is
It's really scary...
------------------------------------------------
[00000175][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
The side using weapons is stronger,
Something stronger than that.
I'm looking for an endlessly powerful weapon...
------------------------------------------------
[00000176][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
There are limits to that.
Such destruction is unreasonable.
That's all I can say...
------------------------------------------------
[00000177][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
That's right...
I think that was really stupid...
------------------------------------------------
[00000178][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000179][パニス,char_002 Panis]
What happened to both of you?
Are you not feeling well...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000180][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
No, it's nothing...
Don't worry……
------------------------------------------------
[00000181][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Oops, it's gone.
What happened to me again...
------------------------------------------------
[00000182][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Sorry, iron boy.
I just can't say too many words.
------------------------------------------------
[00000183][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
No, don't worry...
------------------------------------------------
[00000184][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Moi?
------------------------------------------------
[00000185][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
No problem.
Don't worry, really.
------------------------------------------------
[00000186][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Hmm...
------------------------------------------------
[00000187][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Oh, Kilmaria.
Has the investigation finished?
------------------------------------------------
[00000188][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
From that face, it didn't seem like anything was coming out.
------------------------------------------------
[00000189][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yes, unfortunately...
There is nothing that looks like a note anywhere...
------------------------------------------------
[00000190][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Well then, I can't help it.
Shall we pull it up for today?
------------------------------------------------
[00000191][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That's right. Freed, do you want to go home?
------------------------------------------------
[00000192][フリード,char_001 Fried]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000193][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Freed? what up?
------------------------------------------------
[00000194][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, it's nothing. just……
Before this happened, this island was even more beautiful than it is now.
I thought it must have been...
------------------------------------------------
[00000195][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Really……
That's right...
------------------------------------------------
[00000196][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
This island at that time,
I wanted to see it once...
------------------------------------------------
[00000197][フリード,char_001 Fried]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000198][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hey, Freed.
We are all over the place
I've been re-examining the ruins, but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000199][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
The closest place to the village is
You haven't gone yet, have you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000200][フリード,char_001 Fried]
When you say closest to the village, do you mean the ruins on the cape?
------------------------------------------------
[00000201][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
yes! Maybe this time I'll find something?
------------------------------------------------
[00000202][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Everyone, please check carefully.
Especially in corners or near walls.
If I'm missing something, that's it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000203][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
When Freed cleans the room,
Almost without a doubt
I miss the trash around there.
------------------------------------------------
[00000204][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Sister!
You don't have to say that now, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000205][パニス,char_002 Panis]
i got you! Not...Kakioki!
------------------------------------------------
[00000206][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Even Panis is like that...
------------------------------------------------
[00000207][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Well, that's fine.
So, what does it say?
------------------------------------------------
[00000208][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
...Decoding is complete. Output as audio.
------------------------------------------------
[00000209][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000I was surprised when he came,
Apparently that was a ship from another world.
------------------------------------------------
[00000210][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000 It looks like they're at war with Enfield's army,
I took the plunge and contacted him.
Apparently, the people on the ship weren't at fault.
------------------------------------------------
[00000211][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000From what I hear, it's the people of this world who are at fault.
This must be written down.
To prevent future people from repeating the same mistakes.
------------------------------------------------
[00000212][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
…That’s right.
It's important.
------------------------------------------------
[00000213][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
It looks like we're getting to the core of it.
So what's next?
------------------------------------------------
[00000214][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
The last part reads:
------------------------------------------------
[00000215][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000We are tired of the distortion of civilization,
Also, we fear that our "abilities" will be misused.
I was supposed to have secluded myself on this island, but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000216][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000Depending on the progress of the battle,
You may be forced to use it.
However, it is unavoidable...
------------------------------------------------
[00000217][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
……that's all.
------------------------------------------------
[00000218][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
"ability"? What kind of power is that!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000219][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Maybe it's about Freed's abilities?
In the first place, we started thinking about that.
You were trying to find out, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000220][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hey, hey, Velvet!
calm down!
------------------------------------------------
[00000221][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Unfortunately, the detailed description of "ability" is
Could not be found.
------------------------------------------------
[00000222][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I see... this time,
Some kind of clue about "power"
I thought I would find it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000223][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Well, see you soon,
Maybe you can find something new?
Let's explore some other places!
------------------------------------------------
[00000224][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Yeah, you're right.
After all, I have no choice but to investigate steadily...
------------------------------------------------
[00000225][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
I see.
One by one, we look at the ruins that have not been re-examined.
Don't worry, let's take a look.
------------------------------------------------
[00000226][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
We're getting closer to the core, and we're getting a good response...
------------------------------------------------
[00000227][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000228][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Adam, what's wrong? Are you not feeling well?
------------------------------------------------
[00000229][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Oh, Freed to Miss.
Actually, the iron boy is now
It seems like he's having a bit of a problem.
------------------------------------------------
[00000230][フリード,char_001 Fried]
worries?
------------------------------------------------
[00000231][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Mr. Panis, Mr. Freed.
I am an ancient weapon.
------------------------------------------------
[00000232][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Visiting the ruins of this island once again,
The devastation caused by ancient wars
As soon as I saw it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000233][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I wonder if I was born for such a thing,
Somehow, the blank area of ​​memory is
I am attacked by the feeling that I am increasing my weight unintentionally.
------------------------------------------------
[00000234][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
You probably feel this way,
I think it might be called "empty".
Is that okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000235][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I don't really understand that...
I can kind of understand how Adam feels.
------------------------------------------------
[00000236][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Moimoi...
------------------------------------------------
[00000237][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
thank you……
------------------------------------------------
[00000238][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Those worries are all ours.
I can't help but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000239][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
At this moment, something that is stuck in my heart,
Why don't you just blow it all away?
------------------------------------------------
[00000240][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I agree……
In fact, this tragic war
Why did it happen...
------------------------------------------------
[00000241][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I just can't remember that.
That also slows down my processing speed...
------------------------------------------------
[00000242][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is this the reason why the war broke out?
By the way, Pani before...
I heard a few things from people...
------------------------------------------------
[00000243][パニス,char_002 Panis]
picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000244][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
No, it's nothing.
Don't worry about Panis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000245][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Anyway... just the story of that person...
What happened at that time?
I didn't quite understand it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000246][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That's right.
Why did the war come?
I couldn't hear the details.
------------------------------------------------
[00000247][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
The circumstances that led to the war...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000248][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Viola, do you know anything?
------------------------------------------------
[00000249][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
No, I...
------------------------------------------------
[00000250][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
……Really.
------------------------------------------------
[00000251][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
If you want to find out about the war,
Shouldn't we go to the ruins beyond the Valley of Miasma?
The damage there was terrible...
------------------------------------------------
[00000252][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
But that's why I overlooked it until now.
Maybe there's something left over about the war.
If only Adam was okay with it...but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000253][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I am……
Well, let's go.
No, maybe I should look into it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000254][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
My memory and processing unit are confused,
In order to optimize...
------------------------------------------------
[00000255][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Kilmaria, is your investigation complete?
------------------------------------------------
[00000256][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yes, that's one thing.
But unfortunately there is no harvest...
Nothing particularly new...
------------------------------------------------
[00000257][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Is that the guy who swings in the air?
That's a shame.
------------------------------------------------
[00000258][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Well, I can't help it.
Well then, let's pull it up.
------------------------------------------------
[00000259][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's right.
Freed, Adam, shall we go?
------------------------------------------------
[00000260][フリード,char_001 Fried]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000261][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
what happened?
------------------------------------------------
[00000262][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture? I was looking around.
It's always a horrifying sight to see.
here……
------------------------------------------------
[00000263][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I agree……
I think so too...
------------------------------------------------
[00000264][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Freed...Adam...
------------------------------------------------
[00000265][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I'm sorry, but it would have been better if you hadn't come.
------------------------------------------------
[00000266][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
No, it's fine.
If you avoid facing your past,
That would make the problem even more widespread.
------------------------------------------------
[00000267][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
However, the fact that I was complicit in this...
It puts a considerable burden on my processing ability,
I have to say that this is a serious fact...
------------------------------------------------
[00000268][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
...I don't know if it's any consolation, but...
If you had feelings at that time,
You must have thought that this attack was nothing more than revenge for your friends.
------------------------------------------------
[00000269][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
What do you mean?
------------------------------------------------
[00000270][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Because up until this point,
The other world side attacks various parts of Endias,
It caused a lot of damage...
------------------------------------------------
[00000271][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
They were the ones who started the war.
Suddenly one day, without any warning.
------------------------------------------------
[00000272][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
However, from someone who knows the situation...
According to what I heard, there are also people from other worlds.
I heard that you were being cornered quite a bit...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000273][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Yeah, I think that's definitely true.
In the end, what drove them to this point was
The stupidity of the Enfield people.
------------------------------------------------
[00000274][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
That's totally...stupid.
A smart way to avoid this is to
There should have been plenty of both.
------------------------------------------------
[00000275][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
This is the result of not being able to do that...
A nightmarish place filled with lava and hot air...
------------------------------------------------
[00000276][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I wonder how terrifying the battle was...
And a weapon that can do this much...
How terrifying must it have been...
------------------------------------------------
[00000277][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Hey, Freed.
I just remembered something.
------------------------------------------------
[00000278][フリード,char_001 Fried]
what? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000279][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
I took you before,
You remember the ruins in the sky, right?　
I think I saw a note there too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000280][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What was that!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000281][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Oh, is it true!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000282][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
I just glanced at it,
I didn't think anything of it at the time, but
Now that I think about it, it must have been...
------------------------------------------------
[00000283][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
That's why I'm so curious.
Why don't you go check it out?
------------------------------------------------
[00000284][パニス,char_002 Panis]
In the sky?
Oh!  i wanna go!
------------------------------------------------
[00000285][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hey, wait a minute!
Even if I was told to write it down,
Who left it there?
------------------------------------------------
[00000286][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
How did you get there?
Can you go to a place like that?
Isn't it just like Viola!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000287][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
If you have the ability to fly, it's easy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000288][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Don't say such nonsense!
I mean, that kind of ability,
Not even for you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000289][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Even without the ability to fly,
As long as you have teleportation magic or a warp system, there will be no problem.
------------------------------------------------
[00000290][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Even if you say that,
I don't know what you mean!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000291][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
In other words, when I went to that ruins before,
Just use the same method you used when entering the ship.
------------------------------------------------
[00000292][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
so,
This time, just like before, I'll use my magic!
------------------------------------------------
[00000293][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
there were! Look, everyone! here!
------------------------------------------------
[00000294][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Where, where!? Where?
……a! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000295][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's true……
Viola, you've noticed this often.
------------------------------------------------
[00000296][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
What I'm concerned about is the content.
What does it say?
------------------------------------------------
[00000297][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Deciphering is complete.
Now, output as audio as usual.
------------------------------------------------
[00000298][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000 The battle is becoming more intense, no, it is becoming more and more mired.
Under the influence of this,
There is no trace of the once beautiful island now.
------------------------------------------------
[00000299][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000Both sides,
With each passing day, I become visibly tired.
At this rate, the day will come when there will be a winner or loser.
------------------------------------------------
[00000300][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000 Win/Loss...?　No, that's not true.
There can be no winner in this battle.
What a vain and sad battle.
------------------------------------------------
[00000301][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000, but no matter what the outcome of the battle is,
The idiots at Enfield put it in.
``That'' is the only thing that cannot be left as is.
------------------------------------------------
[00000302][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000Before the battle, my son and my wife used all their abilities.
They were evacuated to a place deemed safe.
However, whether it is really safe there...
------------------------------------------------
[00000303][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000 It is possible to block “that”
It depends on whether you can do it or not.
If you leave "that" as it is...
------------------------------------------------
[00000304][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000 Far from fighting,
Because this world could end.
------------------------------------------------
[00000305][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
……that's all.
------------------------------------------------
[00000306][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
...Somehow, more than ever
It's a tragic piece of writing.
------------------------------------------------
[00000307][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
When I think about the people who left behind notes,
I feel like tears are falling...
------------------------------------------------
[00000308][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's a little cloudy right now so I can't see...
Maybe looking down on the island from here
I guess I wrote it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000309][フリード,char_001 Fried]
If you can see the island...
What did we think...
------------------------------------------------
[00000310][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
The same goes for the island...
In this note,
There were some words that caught my attention.
------------------------------------------------
[00000311][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Are you talking about "ability"?
------------------------------------------------
[00000312][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That's true too...
As for the guy who is called “that”,
I'm kind of curious.
------------------------------------------------
[00000313][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Apparently, for the person who left the note
It seems like an enemy...
I wonder what happened to “that” after this?
------------------------------------------------
[00000314][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That's right.
Did I win or...
------------------------------------------------
[00000315][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I can't say anything at this point.
Anyway, I need to gather more information.
------------------------------------------------
[00000316][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Let's continue the investigation.
...I have to try hard!
------------------------------------------------
[00000317][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hello, Freed.
Did you come to invite me to investigate?
------------------------------------------------
[00000318][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's right, actually...
------------------------------------------------
[00000319][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Shall I guess the destination?
It's a ruin in a cave on a cliff, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000320][フリード,char_001 Fried]
U-Yeah, but...
Understood well, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000321][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
That's the only ruin that hasn't been re-examined.
Simple story. Well then, let's go!
------------------------------------------------
[00000322][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
this is……!
------------------------------------------------
[00000323][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
What's up, Viola?
Did you find something?
------------------------------------------------
[00000324][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Yes, that's a great discovery. It's a data disk!
------------------------------------------------
[00000325][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Disk...? Is that the disc?
Is it a decoration or something?
------------------------------------------------
[00000326][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
There are no words or pictures written...
------------------------------------------------
[00000327][パニス,char_002 Panis]
It's sparkling!
------------------------------------------------
[00000328][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Oh, I see. Don't know about discs?
This is...Adam!　Just a little please.
------------------------------------------------
[00000329][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
A disk inside Adam's belly!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000330][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
what's this! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000331][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Yeah, it's okay.
I was surprised that I had such a function.
...Loading has completed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000332][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
What kind of data does it contain?
------------------------------------------------
[00000333][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
this is……!
The performance of the ancient weapon named "Thor",
It seems to be various data that analyzed its combat power.
------------------------------------------------
[00000334][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Thor...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000335][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Viola, do you know anything?
------------------------------------------------
[00000336][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Yeah, just a little...
I see...I left this disc behind.
If you are the owner of the notes...
------------------------------------------------
[00000337][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
“That” that must be sealed away is
I'm sure it's about "Thor"...
------------------------------------------------
[00000338][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Now, let's talk about the opponent that the owner of the note fought against.
Inside this "Disk" thing...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000339][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
That was a great discovery.
------------------------------------------------
[00000340][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Let's go back to the village and analyze the data.
I need more information. Adam, please help me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000341][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I got it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000342][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (I wonder what kind of information will come out...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000343][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
I have good news and bad news.
The good news is that the disk analysis has been completed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000344][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
...What remains is bad news.
That means that inside the disk,
I mean, it contained incredible information.
------------------------------------------------
[00000345][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
yes. This Thor was born at the end of the ancient war.
It looks like a weapon that was thrown into the mix in a crazy way.
------------------------------------------------
[00000346][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What do you mean by “fuck it”?
------------------------------------------------
[00000347][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
This weapon doesn't seem to be able to be controlled properly.
Once you lose control, your friends and foes will indiscriminately attack you.
Apparently it can destroy everything in sight.
------------------------------------------------
[00000348][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Moreover, the destructive power of Thor alone is
It's said to be comparable to that "Doomsday Titan"...
------------------------------------------------
[00000349][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
The same destructive power as the Titan of the End!?
Did the ancients create it themselves?
------------------------------------------------
[00000350][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
No way...!
Why something like that...
------------------------------------------------
[00000351][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
While fearing the titan of the end,
Did he release something with the same destructive power onto the ground?
How ironic...
------------------------------------------------
[00000352][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I don't think this is insane...
No matter how much power you want, that much power,
There's no way humans can master it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000353][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Yes, Velvet is right...
This Thor belongs to the Enfield people.
A weapon of mass destruction created by distortion.
------------------------------------------------
[00000354][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Probably people from other worlds
The “results” of the group that was researching,
It should have been fed back...
------------------------------------------------
[00000355][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What did you say……!
------------------------------------------------
[00000356][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
According to the records left on the disk, Thor is now
It seems like it's sealed somewhere...
------------------------------------------------
[00000357][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Like other ancient weapons,
There's no guarantee that it won't come back anytime in response to Panis.
I have to do something before that happens...
------------------------------------------------
[00000358][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That's right, if it's a weapon like that,
I have to destroy it no matter what...
------------------------------------------------
[00000359][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
This is exactly the devil!
In the name of Justice, let's exorcise!
------------------------------------------------
[00000360][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Weapons of mass destruction that endanger the world...
If I don't bury it with my own hands...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000361][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Everyone is right.
I have to defeat Thor no matter what...!
Viola, could you lend me a hand?
------------------------------------------------
[00000362][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Of course. To defeat him is
It's like fate for me too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000363][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What do you mean?
------------------------------------------------
[00000364][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
No, it's fine. never mind.
Anyway, where Thor is sealed
Let's head over.
------------------------------------------------
[00000365][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Before that...Freed.
One more thing for you
There's something I want to let you know.
------------------------------------------------
[00000366][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
It's on the example disc.
There were signatures from people who left data and notes.
------------------------------------------------
[00000367][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Name is……
Alastor Karim and Miria Karim.
------------------------------------------------
[00000368][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Karim...!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000369][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What was that!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000370][バッカス,char_527]
...But I understand the story.
An ancient weapon like Thor or something.
Is that really the one inside here?
------------------------------------------------
[00000371][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
ah. There seems to be no mistake.
------------------------------------------------
[00000372][ケルビム,char_529]
This is an unexpected situation.
------------------------------------------------
[00000373][バッカス,char_527]
Totally. Did I live in such a dangerous place...
------------------------------------------------
[00000374][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I think it's possible that you don't notice...
------------------------------------------------
[00000375][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
The seal has been broken.
Let's go!
------------------------------------------------
[00000376][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Understood!
------------------------------------------------
[00000377][バッカス,char_527]
Understood! Let's go, Deputy Chief!
------------------------------------------------
[00000378][ケルビム,char_529]
yes!
------------------------------------------------
[00000379][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Wait a minute, Bacchus.
You and Cherubim go to the village.
I want everyone to be protected just in case.
------------------------------------------------
[00000380][バッカス,char_527]
Oh, hey!? What are you saying?
This is me, right?
What will happen if I don't fight?
------------------------------------------------
[00000381][ケルビム,char_529]
me too.
I cannot accept Velvet-san's instructions.
------------------------------------------------
[00000382][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It's not an instruction. I'm asking for it.
In times of emergency, you can rely on the village.
Only you guys exist.
------------------------------------------------
[00000383][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
That's right. And Bacchus
If you could stay as a backup,
He feels safe when he has to retreat.
------------------------------------------------
[00000384][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Bacchus, Cherubim. I'll ask you too.
Make everyone in the village feel safe.
------------------------------------------------
[00000385][バッカス,char_527]
……Really.
If that's the case, I can't help it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000386][ケルビム,char_529]
I got it.
We will stand by as a rear guard unit.
------------------------------------------------
[00000387][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yes, I asked for it! Well then, hurry to the village!
See you later!
------------------------------------------------
[00000388][バッカス,char_527]
……Understood! You guys, get back safely!?
If it looks dangerous, I'll rush right away!
------------------------------------------------
[00000389][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
...I said something that was out of character,
Before fighting a strong enemy, preparation is important.
------------------------------------------------
[00000390][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
That's right.
Now then, let's take a look at Thor and the others' preparations.
------------------------------------------------
[00000391][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Strike here before you cause harm to the village!
------------------------------------------------
[00000392][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
All for Justice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000393][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
If we don't correct the ancient distortions...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000394][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Panis, Freed.
Are you ready?
------------------------------------------------
[00000395][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis is fine!
Freed and everyone else are together!
------------------------------------------------
[00000396][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I'm fine too.
As long as everyone is here, we can always fight!
------------------------------------------------
[00000397][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Well then, isn't that good?
Everyone, let's go!
------------------------------------------------
[00000398][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000 Thor was somehow able to seal it away.
However, we were also seriously injured and exhausted our strength.
------------------------------------------------
[00000399][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000The way he spells out the notes is also unsteady.
At this rate, my life won't be long.
But now my heart is full of joy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000400][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000My wife and I live in the world where our beloved son lives...
In other words, he protected the future of Endias.
As a parent, have you ever been so happy?
------------------------------------------------
[00000401][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000With our ability to manipulate time,
Letting my son escape into the future
Apparently it was the right decision.
------------------------------------------------
[00000402][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000 Endias where he lives 1000 years from now,
What kind of world is it like?
We can't even predict.
------------------------------------------------
[00000403][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000However, no matter what kind of world it is,
I want my son to be happy.
That's what we fought for.
------------------------------------------------
[00000404][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000 My beloved son Freed.
You'll never see this note,
You won't even know about us...
------------------------------------------------
[00000405][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000 We wish you happiness forever.
Goodbye, Freed...
------------------------------------------------
[00000406][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
The ability to manipulate time... huh? Freed's power is
It was something he inherited from his parents.
------------------------------------------------
[00000407][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Of course,
I can practice and use it too,
I guess that's not possible...
------------------------------------------------
[00000408][フリード,char_001 Fried]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000409][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Freed...
------------------------------------------------
[00000410][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Sister...
My...father and mother...
here……
------------------------------------------------
[00000411][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Trying to protect me...
My father and mother...
Ugh...uuuuuu...
------------------------------------------------
[00000412][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Don't cry, Freed...
------------------------------------------------
[00000413][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That's right, Freed.
I understand how you feel, but don't lose heart...
------------------------------------------------
[00000414][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
you were crying so much,
Your parents will probably feel sad too...
So let's cheer up...
------------------------------------------------
[00000415][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Sorry, everyone...
But... I...
------------------------------------------------
[00000416][パニス,char_002 Panis]
…………Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000417][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Panis?
------------------------------------------------
[00000418][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed...
sorry Sorry……
------------------------------------------------
[00000419][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis...?
Maybe... you have a memory?
------------------------------------------------
[00000420][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Keep it...? do not know……
but……
------------------------------------------------
[00000421][パニス,char_002 Panis]
sorry……
------------------------------------------------
[00000422][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis...
------------------------------------------------
[00000423][パニス,char_002 Panis]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000424][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis...don't look so sad.
Because... I'm fine.
------------------------------------------------
[00000425][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I found a letter from my father and mother,
If you think that no matter what you do, you won't be able to meet...
------------------------------------------------
[00000426][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But I have Panis...
I also have older sisters, uncles, and aunts.
------------------------------------------------
[00000427][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Even if my father and mother are no longer here,
I do have a family.
------------------------------------------------
[00000428][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed...
Ehehe...
------------------------------------------------
[00000429][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's right, Freed.
Panis and I will always be with you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000430][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
After all, we're family!
------------------------------------------------
[00000431][フリード,char_001 Fried]
thank you……
Shannon, Panis...
------------------------------------------------
[00000432][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Besides, it's not just my sister and Panis.
Zynga, Adam, Kill Maria, Velvet,
Levin, Viola-san, and everyone else in the village...
------------------------------------------------
[00000433][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Like family, no matter the hardships or pleasures,
I also have friends that I have shared with.
So I don't feel lonely.
------------------------------------------------
[00000434][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Come on, everyone! Let's go back to our village!
------------------------------------------------
[00000435][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Well, the job is done.
Are you going to raise it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000436][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I told everyone in the village that the crisis was over.
I have to report it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000437][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Well, I have to look for another piece of information.
------------------------------------------------
[00000438][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
This time for real
It looks like a peaceful life will return.
Will I finally be able to concentrate on my main job as a fisherman?
------------------------------------------------
[00000439][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
If possible, I would also like to devote myself to the farm.
Growing plants is
It's a really rewarding job.
------------------------------------------------
[00000440][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Panis, Freed! let's go!
------------------------------------------------
[00000441][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000442][フリード,char_001 Fried]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000443][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed?
------------------------------------------------
[00000444][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, no, it's nothing.
Come on, let's go home!
------------------------------------------------
[00000445][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah!
------------------------------------------------
[00000446][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Thank you, Mom and Dad.
I'm living happily on this island now.)
------------------------------------------------
