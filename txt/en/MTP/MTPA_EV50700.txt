[00000000][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What are you trying to do by force?
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
It's probably already decided.
I'll have you as my sword opponent.
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's it!
There's no reason to fight!
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
reason? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
If men and men face each other seriously,
There's always going to be a fight, boy!
Now, draw your sword!
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Come on, let's talk.
Your troubles.
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][フリード,char_001 Fried]
So, I don't have anything special...
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Don't be fooled.
Is it written on your face?
I'm worried.
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Even if you hold it in your stomach, it won't do you any good.
Take it all out and get a clean look!
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis...
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Miss?
What happened to that girl?
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis isn't coming back.
I destroyed the village and was blamed by everyone.
It just jumped out...
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Did you destroy the village? Is that that girl?
That's certainly a big deal.
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][フリード,char_001 Fried]
The village is falling apart...
Everyone, Panis is from the village...
Even the enemies of the world have murderous intent...
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
……Really.
That must be a tough spot for you.
Both are important bonds...
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Am I...Panis or Mura...
I guess I have to choose one...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
in? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][フリード,char_001 Fried]
……me?
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
That's it.
What about the village, what about the world, etc.
Let's put aside what everyone else thinks.
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Freed Karim.
what do you want to do?
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I...I...
I want Panis to come back!
I want to be with Panis!
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But I don't want to give up on my village or the world!
...This kind of thing is greedy, isn't it?
After all, I have to choose one...
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Get rid of the idiot!
If you want to do that, don't let either go!
Greedy! You should show more of yourself!
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Besides, the bonds I let go of,
It will become a thorn that will stick in your heart for the rest of your life.
No matter what circumstances he gave up on...
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Levin...
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hey Levin.
me……
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Phew, it seems like my stomach is getting harder.
That's the story from me.
that! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Wow!
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hmm.
Do you feel a little better now?
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Levin...
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
If I feel like it, I'll play with you again.
Bye!
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...It seems like he's not here.
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I'm walking confidently,
I thought I was sure of something,
Isn't it just a guess...
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It can't be helped, right?
I have no idea where Panis is,
I have no choice but to search for it exhaustively.
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Moreover, when I was looking for it obsessively,
Before you know it, you're surrounded by monsters.
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Yes, yes, sorry.
I'll listen to all your complaints later.
But now I have to defeat the monster!
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...Whew.
It took up a lot of my time.
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What should I do now?
Shall we search here a little more?
Or should I try something else?
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Let's go back to the village.
I might hear new information.
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
This is where medicinal herbs grow.
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Monsters are roaming around.
Fighting monsters while gathering medicinal herbs
Isn't it dangerous?
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's true too.
Let's defeat the monsters first.
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Okay, the monster is gone.
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Now I can finally collect medicinal herbs.
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I hope the animals get better with this medicinal herb.
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][バッカス,char_527]
what?
Are you the only three?
What are the other guys doing?
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It's noisy!
We are enough as your opponents.
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][フリード,char_001 Fried]
This isn't the time to be dealing with you.
I'm sorry, but could you come home?
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][バッカス,char_527]
W-what? It doesn't feel right.
Are you guys acting strange?
Did you eat anything strange?
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
We're not at that point right now.
This isn't the time to play with you.
Can you come home for today?
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][バッカス,char_527]
……Geez!
Even though I took the trouble to come,
What's with that careless attitude?
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][バッカス,char_527]
I'm already mad!
I'll get you all fired up again!
Be prepared!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][バッカス,char_527]
...Hey, what's that weak attack?
Are you making fun of me!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][フリード,char_001 Fried]
……picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][バッカス,char_527]
You idiot!!
Your usual attacks are
I’m sure it’s not that crazy!
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][バッカス,char_527]
More like this, Zun! Or Zuba! And,
It's like a shock reverberates to the core of your body.
It must have been such a sharp attack!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Even if you say that...
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][バッカス,char_527]
Yes, it's a pain!
Okay, call me again!
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][バッカス,char_527]
...Hey, how many times do I have to say it before you understand?
Come more seriously!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, I'm being completely serious...
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][バッカス,char_527]
Don't kid yourself!
Compared to your usual attacks,
Now it's like being poked with a needle!
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][バッカス,char_527]
Show us your full power!
Let's try again!
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][バッカス,char_527]
...Bell, you look so stupid.
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Huh?
There's no reason for you to talk about my face!
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][バッカス,char_527]
When you teamed up with me, you were
It was shining even more.
Stronger than anyone, more beautiful than anyone...
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What?
Even though you praised me,
I'm not particularly happy...
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][バッカス,char_527]
Bell.
Bring back the shine of that time!
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][バッカス,char_527]
...It's not going to happen.
You guys shouldn't be like that!
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][バッカス,char_527]
Teamwork is inconsistent!
The attack coordination is completely crazy!
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...Wow, that's noisy!
That has nothing to do with you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][バッカス,char_527]
If you were the same as usual, that wouldn't have happened!
Both attack and defense were in perfect harmony!
How about that, now it's okay to be lousy!
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][バッカス,char_527]
Will you be able to defeat me with such a back-breaking attack?
Let's start over! Please take it more seriously!
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][バッカス,char_527]
Well, you can do it if you try...
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][フリード,char_001 Fried]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][バッカス,char_527]
Oi oi oi oi!
Even though you won against me,
What's that disappointing aspect?
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][バッカス,char_527]
Always look triumphant
Wouldn't it be nice to do a fist pump?
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][バッカス,char_527]
Tsk! Don't do it!
I'm going home. I'm going home!
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][バッカス,char_527]
...Listen!
Finally, let me say this!
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][バッカス,char_527]
When the time comes, what you can do to help is
It’s not just people from the village! Same goes for me!
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][バッカス,char_527]
If you're having trouble,
Come and talk to us anytime!
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Bacchus...
------------------------------------------------
[00000083][バッカス,char_527]
Well then, bye bye!
------------------------------------------------
[00000084][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Panis is always picking medicinal herbs.
It's like here.
------------------------------------------------
[00000085][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I'm worried about Boris.
Let's bring the medicinal herbs home quickly.
------------------------------------------------
[00000086][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's right!
Let's quickly defeat the monsters!
------------------------------------------------
[00000087][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Huh.
The monsters are gone.
------------------------------------------------
[00000088][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Well then, let's collect medicinal herbs.
------------------------------------------------
[00000089][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree. Collect them quickly and return to the village!
------------------------------------------------
[00000090][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
The stone monument I mentioned earlier
Here it is...
------------------------------------------------
[00000091][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
The monsters wandering around are a nuisance.
------------------------------------------------
[00000092][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Just get rid of anyone who gets in your way!
Let's kick it all out!
------------------------------------------------
[00000093][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Okay, the current monster is the last one.
------------------------------------------------
[00000094][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000095][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What's wrong, Mr. Kilmaria?
------------------------------------------------
[00000096][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
...After all, fighting in cooperation with friends
That's wonderful!
------------------------------------------------
[00000097][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Huh?
What are you saying all of a sudden?
------------------------------------------------
[00000098][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
It's been a while since I fought with you all,
I'm so impressed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000099][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Cooperate with your friends, cooperate, and win!
This is what friendship is all about!
This is Justice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000100][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It's bad that I'm immersed in it, but
Could you please show me to the stone monument now?
------------------------------------------------
[00000101][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Ha! That's right.
It just got hot...
Everyone, this is it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000102][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
There were kids!
Beyond that bush!
------------------------------------------------
[00000103][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's bad.
A monster is heading that way.
------------------------------------------------
[00000104][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Children are in danger!
Let's hurry!
------------------------------------------------
[00000105][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Okay! The monsters have been taken care of!
------------------------------------------------
[00000106][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
The kids... they all seem to be okay.
------------------------------------------------
[00000107][メリー,char_509]
Freed, everyone.
sorry……
------------------------------------------------
[00000108][メリー,char_509]
I was picking flowers for Panis.
Then a monster came...
------------------------------------------------
[00000109][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is that so……
But don't worry everyone.
------------------------------------------------
[00000110][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Well, I'm glad you were okay.
For now, let's go to everyone in the vigilante group.
Let's take him.
------------------------------------------------
[00000111][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
thank you!
Mr. Levin! It was helpful!
------------------------------------------------
[00000112][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I don't need any courtesy.
This is what I'm doing for my own convenience.
Rather than that, we need to do something about that girl first!
------------------------------------------------
[00000113][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree!
Panis...I'll go now, so wait...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000114][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis!
It's dangerous there! Come here!
------------------------------------------------
[00000115][パニス,char_002 Panis]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000116][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis...
What on earth happened!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000117][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed...I'm sorry.
I……
------------------------------------------------
[00000118][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Panis... please.
Trust us.
------------------------------------------------
[00000119][パニス,char_002 Panis]
older sister……
Please, don't come here.
------------------------------------------------
[00000120][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I don't want to fight you!
Panis...come back!
------------------------------------------------
[00000121][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Mr. Panis, please listen!
It is wrong for us to fight!
This is extremely contrary to justice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000122][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Kill Maria...
------------------------------------------------
[00000123][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
There's something wrong, right?
Let's talk.
If we talk, we'll definitely understand each other!
------------------------------------------------
[00000124][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Panis, can you hear me?
Don't play around like that forever,
Come here quickly!
------------------------------------------------
[00000125][パニス,char_002 Panis]
velvet……
------------------------------------------------
[00000126][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
The people here are your important people, right?
Can't you trust that important person?
------------------------------------------------
[00000127][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I believe in everyone...
------------------------------------------------
[00000128][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Miss, don't worry.
Get out and come here.
Don't worry, I won't do anything bad.
------------------------------------------------
[00000129][パニス,char_002 Panis]
but……
------------------------------------------------
[00000130][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Can't you believe my words?
Then don't tell me to believe in me.
Believe in Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000131][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I believe in Freed...
------------------------------------------------
[00000132][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
In this cruel world,
He's a rare and trustworthy guy.
I believed him. What about you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000133][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Human beings cannot survive alone.
If so, ask your friends.
Freed is a reliable guy, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000134][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Levin...
Me... Freed...
Is it okay to rely on everyone...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000135][]
Aaaaaaaaaaaa...
------------------------------------------------
[00000136][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Did you defeat it...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000137][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Apparently so.
but……
------------------------------------------------
[00000138][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
That voice...
How sad...
------------------------------------------------
[00000139][パニス,char_002 Panis]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000140][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis...
