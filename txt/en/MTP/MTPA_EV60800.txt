[00000000][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I'm grateful to have met you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I have no regrets.
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Honestly, I don't really know.
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hey, Freed...please answer honestly.
Do you regret meeting me?
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][パニス,char_002 Panis]
……thank you.
I'm also grateful to have met you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yes...thank you.
You're so kind, Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yes...that's right.
Sorry to hear that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][パニス,char_002 Panis]
...That's right.
That's not an easy question to answer.
sorry. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed, I'm really sorry...
I caused trouble to everyone in the village...
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Also for Adam and Zynga,
Of course to everyone in the village,
I want you to apologize from my mouth...
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][パニス,char_002 Panis]
On top of that, I will explain my circumstances again,
I want to talk about my feelings...
It would be nice if you could understand...
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Adam understood...
I was really happy...
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Next is Zinga...
And to everyone in the village...
I would like to explain the situation properly from my own mouth.
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Everyone lends me their strength...
I'm really... really happy...
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed...Thank you...
It's all thanks to you...
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Mana filling is complete.
In order to restart the ship, work is required inside the ship.
It's already late today, so let's start tomorrow.
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][パニス,char_002 Panis]
...It's finally here, Freed.
I'm really glad I met you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
We are all part of the Panis family.
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...If it's okay.
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I don't want to break up with Panis...
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Finally, let's go to the world where Panis was born.
Panis' family is over there, right?
It means a family connected by blood.
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...Yeah, that's right.
Freed is right.
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Even if they are not related by blood,
Panis and I are family too.
It won't change.
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...That's right.
When I put myself in Panis' shoes, I can't bear it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Freed! That's too selfish!
Even Panis would be better off living with his real family.
I'm sure it's good...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...If I say that I don't think like that,
It would be a lie though...
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Freed...
No...it's fine. It's nothing.
never mind……
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Panis is so much
She must have felt so sad...
I didn't understand at all...
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
We have to help that child!
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
You said, "Let me think about it"...
I wonder if Viola understands...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
But being able to face each other and talk like this,
After all, it's necessary for the village.
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hey Freed, would you like to go to the cove?
Let's have a proper talk with Zynga.
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I wondered what would happen for a while, but
I'm glad that everyone in the village understood.
It's really important to convey it through words...
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
If you've come this far, you'll definitely have to defeat the Titan of the End,
Let's save the world of Panis and this world!
Freed, let's do our best!
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
You'll understand when you go.
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It's the world of Panis, so it must be a good place.
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It could be a very dangerous place...
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Far from the open sea or the continent,
I never expected it to go outside the world...
Freed, what kind of world do you think is out there?
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Hahaha! That's right!
There's no use worrying about everything here.
Okay, let's have some fun and see the other world!
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Well, maybe so.
But you really panis
I trust you...
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Hey, are you scared now?
You must be well aware of the risks.
Freed, this isn't like you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
...Ah, I certainly can't even imagine it.
Me too. I have no idea.
I really have no choice but to go and see it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
No matter how many times I come, my opinion will never change.
Sorry, please come back...
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
If Panis is saved, the village will also be saved.
Panis is also a member of the village, so let's save them all together.
Hehehe, that's just like you, Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
you are always right
That's why I will fight against the titan of the end with all my might!
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
A giant of the end...
I'm sure he's an incredible guy...
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
However, if Freed and everyone in this village were there,
I feel like he's pretty good somehow.
It's strange.
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Of course there is!
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Anyway, let's try it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Hmm, what do you think?
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Velvet's hypothesis,
Based on information from Kilmaria and Viola
I made a lot of guesses, but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
From now on, I, the machine,
I'm starting to wonder if I can help you.
Do I have "feelings" or "heart"?
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
thank you. It seems that the unstable program has become normal.
Now you can move towards your goal!
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I agree. It seems that the program has become unstable.
I'll cut through my doubts and do my best.
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Even Mr. Freed doesn't understand...
very sorry.
It seems that the program is a little unstable.
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I'm sorry to hear that you have a hard time answering.
Give the program some time to stabilize.
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Searching for enemy species.
Tactical protocol SD103 applied.
As soon as the elimination target is found, it will attack without warning.
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
My actions are controlled by the anti-otherworlder program,
We apologize for the inconvenience.
I am sorry.
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
But things will be different from now on.
I threw away the old program,
He follows his "heart".
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
The solution is to eliminate the Doomsday Titan,
It far exceeds my logical calculations.
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
All the humans... especially Mr. Freed.
I am amazed at his flexible thinking and responsiveness.
I also want to be like that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Thanks to Mr. Panis, I
Learn about joy, sadness, and the heart of caring for others.
He was able to choose his own path in life.
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
By saving Mr. Panis' world,
I would like to return this favor.
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
That's not true!
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
never mind.
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I wonder what about?
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
...In the end, without Viola's advice,
I didn't know how to express my "feelings".
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I still don't have enough training...
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
……thank you.
I'm glad you're feeling good, but
The truth is that I didn't understand.
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
So, at least, I would like to take this opportunity to hear from Viola-san.
I'm looking forward to learning a lot!
I will change my mind and do my best!
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
That doesn't work.
Still, I only have a theory.
It turns out that practice hasn't caught up.
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I will accept this humbly and do my best!
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Mr. Freed doesn't understand...
sorry. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
This story is for Mr. Freed.
It didn't matter.
I'm sorry……
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Panis' friends...
And Mr. Panis himself...
It must have been a very difficult experience...
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I didn't know anything about it until now...
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Viola said she would kill Panis.
Thank you for showing some understanding...
This is exactly what Justice is!
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Behind the angel legend passed down on the island,
I never thought that such a fact would come to light...
My hard work and continued research was worth it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
This time, people suffering in another world,
And in order to save Mr. Panis,
I'll do my best!
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
To the giant of the end,
I'm sure Justice will work!
Because that's what Justice is!
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I kind of understand that feeling too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Velvet is positive.
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That's a lot of leeway...
------------------------------------------------
[00000083][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I feel bad for Panis if I say this, but
It's getting kind of interesting, isn't it?
It's exciting to go somewhere you don't know!
------------------------------------------------
[00000084][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Right?It's better to go without thinking too hard,
It turns out to be something that goes well.
------------------------------------------------
[00000085][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Let's do our best and feel excited!
------------------------------------------------
[00000086][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Even if I look backwards or feel anxious,
It won't do anything, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000087][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Let's move forward together,
Let's do our best!
------------------------------------------------
[00000088][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
bad?
I was depressed at this level,
There's nothing to solve it, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000089][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
...Why, it's okay to just reply.
It makes me feel excited. That's enough.
------------------------------------------------
[00000090][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Panis who became an adult,
Surprisingly, he has a lot of guts...
I don't hate that kind of girl, do you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000091][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
After Adam is Viola, then Zynga...
Even though they're all nice adults,
If I can take care of you, I won't be able to do it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000092][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
The story is getting too big,
I don't really feel it at all.
------------------------------------------------
[00000093][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
But hey, that's all for you guys.
We've been dating.
I'll save the other world too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000094][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
The sight of everyone in the village working together as one,
It looks very reliable.
------------------------------------------------
[00000095][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Although it's a little different from the "power" I'm looking for,
Maybe something like this
Maybe it's real "power"...
------------------------------------------------
[00000096][ガルゼー,char_501]
For Panis-chan,
Apparently she goes around talking to each and every villager...
------------------------------------------------
[00000097][ガルゼー,char_501]
I can't say whether that's right or wrong.
But let me just say this. I'm rooting for you...
------------------------------------------------
[00000098][ガルゼー,char_501]
I believed in Panis-chan from the beginning.
However, the position of village chief,
She didn't allow it to happen openly.
------------------------------------------------
[00000099][ガルゼー,char_501]
These past few days have been painful...
No, it was Panis-chan who really suffered.
When I think about that, my suffering is nothing.
------------------------------------------------
[00000100][ガルゼー,char_501]
However, Panis-chan did not run away.
She explained it to us in her own words.
Now it's my turn to respond.
------------------------------------------------
[00000101][ガルゼー,char_501]
As the village chief, I will protect everyone in the village.
You don't have to worry too much,
Just think about the Doomsday Titan.
------------------------------------------------
[00000102][ガルゼー,char_501]
I asked for Panis-chan and her world!
------------------------------------------------
[00000103][ジム,char_502]
Nice to meet you, Jim!
------------------------------------------------
[00000104][ジム,char_502]
Let's do our best together!
------------------------------------------------
[00000105][ジム,char_502]
Thanks, Jim!
------------------------------------------------
[00000106][ジム,char_502]
There are many things I don't like about you,
I have no choice but for the sake of the village!
I agree with your opinion, and I'll lend you a hand!
------------------------------------------------
[00000107][ジム,char_502]
Hmm! I'll do my best this time!
------------------------------------------------
[00000108][ジム,char_502]
Only this time! Because it's just this time!
------------------------------------------------
[00000109][ジム,char_502]
You idiot! Sorry for the misunderstanding!
It's not for you!
There's no reason to say thank you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000110][ジム,char_502]
What are you talking about?
You should work too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000111][ジム,char_502]
Don't get me wrong!?
I still didn't trust Panis.
Because I didn't know!
------------------------------------------------
[00000112][ジム,char_502]
just……
I need to hear from Panis himself.
She just can't accept it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000113][ジム,char_502]
Well, it's not like I've forgiven Panis!
Well, it's true that he destroyed the village...
------------------------------------------------
[00000114][ジム,char_502]
But, it's true that he saved the village...
Oh, I'm going to hurt Panis,
I've said a lot...
------------------------------------------------
[00000115][ジム,char_502]
Wow! Panis~! Sorry!
I don't mean any harm! Please forgive me!
------------------------------------------------
[00000116][ジム,char_502]
As a result, we
I'm going to save this world...
Does that mean we are heroes?
------------------------------------------------
[00000117][ジム,char_502]
Hahaha! Wow!
Everyone, thank us,
I'm so excited!
------------------------------------------------
[00000118][マイア,char_503]
As a homeroom teacher, I have expressed Panis-chan's painful feelings.
I regret not being able to understand her...
------------------------------------------------
[00000119][マイア,char_503]
I managed to unite the hearts of the villagers once again,
I wonder if I can help Panis-chan...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000120][マイア,char_503]
A village is coming together around you...
Freed-kun, you did your best...
------------------------------------------------
[00000121][マイア,char_503]
If this village unites, we will be invincible!
Come on, let's help Panis-chan!
------------------------------------------------
[00000122][マイア,char_503]
I cannot tolerate a world where children cannot live in peace!
It's the same thing in Panis-chan's world!
I will also do my best for the future of my children!
------------------------------------------------
[00000123][アリーゼ,char_504]
I want to help Panis-chan, but...
As for the fact that he is not there...
There's nothing I can do about it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000124][アリーゼ,char_504]
Panis-chan is finally back!
I understand the situation.
From now on, I have to lend a hand with all my might!
------------------------------------------------
[00000125][アリーゼ,char_504]
Let's all save Panis-chan's hometown!
Show your feelings to the giant of the end!
I'll do my best!
------------------------------------------------
[00000126][ダイアナ,char_505]
Panis is not next to you...
It's even unnatural now...
That's strange...
------------------------------------------------
[00000127][ダイアナ,char_505]
Although I'm not next to Freed...
After all, I feel calm when Panis is in this village...
Fufufufufu……
------------------------------------------------
[00000128][ダイアナ,char_505]
I'm leaving soon...
I wonder what kind of wonderful items there are in this other world...
Fufufufufufufufufufu…
------------------------------------------------
[00000129][ドルトン,char_506]
I really don't think Panis is thinking anything bad,
The fact that he hid her figure means that
I guess she has something to feel guilty about...
------------------------------------------------
[00000130][ドルトン,char_506]
I don't know what's going on anymore...
------------------------------------------------
[00000131][ドルトン,char_506]
Even in a different world, things seem to be difficult.
Let's use everyone's power to help.
Hey, if I have my weapon, I can do anything!
------------------------------------------------
[00000132][ドルトン,char_506]
No matter what enemy appears, never flinch!
You have a weapon made by me!
There's no way I could lose with my weapon!
------------------------------------------------
[00000133][ロラン,char_507]
I need Roland's cooperation for that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000134][ロラン,char_507]
Oh, leave it to me!
------------------------------------------------
[00000135][ロラン,char_507]
I'll try as much as I can.
------------------------------------------------
[00000136][ロラン,char_507]
Freed!
Please help Panis!
------------------------------------------------
[00000137][ロラン,char_507]
do! We'll cooperate, so let's help Panis together!
------------------------------------------------
[00000138][ロラン,char_507]
Hehehe, I see.
I guess I can help Panis too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000139][ロラン,char_507]
If Freed says so,
I feel safe now!
------------------------------------------------
[00000140][ロラン,char_507]
How dare you be so weak!
I won't give up, no matter what!
------------------------------------------------
[00000141][ロラン,char_507]
What happened...
When Freed goes silent...
I'm getting worried...
------------------------------------------------
[00000142][ロラン,char_507]
Panis is currently in the ruins...?
I'm worried about whether you're eating properly...
Panis looks like a big eater...
------------------------------------------------
[00000143][ロラン,char_507]
Hey, Freed!
Teach me how to bake bread!
I want to make bread for Panis!
------------------------------------------------
[00000144][ロラン,char_507]
I'll protect Panis! I've already decided!
------------------------------------------------
[00000145][ロラン,char_507]
So please teach me that amazing technique!
See, Freed always does this.
That guy that makes you laugh!
------------------------------------------------
[00000146][ロラン,char_507]
How long will it be on the boat to reach the world of Panis?
If you don't bring snacks, you'll get hungry, right?
I have to make sure I don't forget anything...
------------------------------------------------
[00000147][カール,char_508]
Panis, you're back, right?
Why didn't you tell me!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000148][カール,char_508]
It's so cunning to keep it that way!
I want to meet you too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000149][カール,char_508]
I haven't played with Panis yet...
I'm glad you're back, but I feel lonely...
------------------------------------------------
[00000150][カール,char_508]
...But I can stand it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000151][カール,char_508]
I helped you a lot!
I worked hard for Panis!
------------------------------------------------
[00000152][メリー,char_509]
Panis looked like an older sister.
The way he spoke was different than usual.
However, his face was the same when he laughed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000153][メリー,char_509]
Panis said, “Thank you for the flowers!”
I, so that the world of Panis can be saved,
I'll do my best to help you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000154][メリー,char_509]
I'll do anything for Panis!
After all, Panis is a great friend!
------------------------------------------------
[00000155][ハンス,char_510]
I can't forgive you if you're trying to do something with the village, but...
I don't think Panis would do anything wrong for no reason.
First of all, don't listen to me properly...
------------------------------------------------
[00000156][ハンス,char_510]
I'm so glad Panis is back!
You did a great job, Freed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000157][ハンス,char_510]
Thanks to you, the village became one!
Let's all go one step further!
------------------------------------------------
[00000158][ハンス,char_510]
If we do something about the Titan of the End,
There won't be any monsters appearing in the village anymore, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000159][ハンス,char_510]
If Panis can be saved then,
How old are you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000160][ハンス,char_510]
Hey!
I too, for the village, for Alise,
You have to keep your spirits up!
------------------------------------------------
[00000161][ボリス,char_511]
Well, Panis is a good girl after all.
I can't believe that Panis would do such a thing.
This may have happened often...
------------------------------------------------
[00000162][ボリス,char_511]
I need to ask that girl some questions...
------------------------------------------------
[00000163][ボリス,char_511]
Either way, I'll whip my old bones,
I guess I'll cooperate with Panis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000164][ボリス,char_511]
I won't lose to young people!
I'll make another flower bloom!
------------------------------------------------
[00000165][ボリス,char_511]
It's time to finally face off against the titan of the end.
Considering Panis' suffering;
There's nothing wrong with lower back pain!
------------------------------------------------
[00000166][デボラ,char_512]
Peter comes and says...
Let's believe in Panis-chan...
That's serious...
------------------------------------------------
[00000167][デボラ,char_512]
I'm confused...
Is that child an angel?
Or is he really a demon...
------------------------------------------------
[00000168][デボラ,char_512]
Panis-chan has also been through a lot of hardship...
It's such a shame that she didn't notice...
------------------------------------------------
[00000169][デボラ,char_512]
I took Freed and Panis-chan with me,
Please come visit us again.
I'll prepare some sweets and wait for you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000170][デボラ,char_512]
Are you going to save Panis-chan's world?
So that we can all return home safely,
I need to pray hard.
------------------------------------------------
[00000171][デボラ,char_512]
It seems that the guardian deity will also come with us,
I'm sure it'll be fine, though.
------------------------------------------------
[00000172][ハイラム,char_513]
of course! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000173][ハイラム,char_513]
That's right, I have to try my best too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000174][ハイラム,char_513]
Even if they aren't related by blood.
------------------------------------------------
[00000175][ハイラム,char_513]
Angel...ancient...person from another world...
No matter what his true identity is, Panis is my child.
There's no difference in what I'm saying.
------------------------------------------------
[00000176][ハイラム,char_513]
No matter what happens, let's support each other as a family.
------------------------------------------------
[00000177][ハイラム,char_513]
Oh, that's right.
There was no need for my uncle to say anything.
------------------------------------------------
[00000178][ハイラム,char_513]
Freed is always my sister...
And he also takes good care of her sister.
------------------------------------------------
[00000179][ハイラム,char_513]
Good luck, Freed!
My uncle is counting on me too, hahaha.
------------------------------------------------
[00000180][ハイラム,char_513]
Freed...
That's a bit sad, uncle.
Even my aunt would be sad if she heard what happened now.
------------------------------------------------
[00000181][ハイラム,char_513]
Whether related by blood or not,
You and Panis are our children.
I just don't want you to forget that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000182][ハイラム,char_513]
Freed, please be strong.
------------------------------------------------
[00000183][ハイラム,char_513]
Not just panis
My uncle, my aunt, and Shannon.
Because I'm counting on you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000184][ハイラム,char_513]
My mom and I always talk about Shannon, Freed,
And he's on Panis's side.
But don't be too reckless.
------------------------------------------------
[00000185][ハイラム,char_513]
Freed, you did a good job of summarizing the village so far.
As expected of his father's son. It's a big deal.
Everyone in the village trusts you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000186][ハイラム,char_513]
We're all ready.
Come on, my daughter Panis and her world.
Let's go save the day!
------------------------------------------------
[00000187][リアン,char_514]
Is Panis safe?
Yes, that's good.
------------------------------------------------
[00000188][リアン,char_514]
We have freshly baked bread waiting for you,
Please come home anytime,
Could you please tell me that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000189][リアン,char_514]
As a mother, what do you think about Panis?
I scolded him a lot.
All I have to do is worry about my parents...
------------------------------------------------
[00000190][リアン,char_514]
But Panis came back,
I'm really happy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000191][リアン,char_514]
Freed, Shannon, Panis-chan, and father...
It's really a blessing to be together with everyone.
------------------------------------------------
[00000192][リアン,char_514]
However, in order to protect such everyday life,
I guess I have to face off against the Titan of the Apocalypse.
------------------------------------------------
[00000193][リアン,char_514]
Freed, be careful... No, good luck!
------------------------------------------------
[00000194][ダリオ,char_515]
Panis is back, right?
How are you doing? Are you OK?
------------------------------------------------
[00000195][ダリオ,char_515]
It feels like the village has finally become one.
I feel safe now.
As expected of you, Freed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000196][ダリオ,char_515]
It's getting kind of interesting!
The power of a united village,
Let's show it to the giant of the end!
------------------------------------------------
[00000197][ミルコ,char_516]
Panis in trouble,
I can't leave it like this.
------------------------------------------------
[00000198][ミルコ,char_516]
If you think about it, Panis is also a friend of the village.
It's only natural for the vigilante group to help Panis.
...Well, it's a little scary though.
------------------------------------------------
[00000199][ミルコ,char_516]
I'm still a little scared though...
No, now is the time to muster up your courage!
Don't do it now, when will you do it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000200][ロドリゴ,char_517]
About Panis...
I hope Zynga understands.
Freed, do your best for Panis!
------------------------------------------------
[00000201][ロドリゴ,char_517]
In order to move the ship,
We have to prepare something at the ruins, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000202][ロドリゴ,char_517]
In that case, let's all split up,
Please help Panis!
Freed, leave the defense of the village to us!
------------------------------------------------
[00000203][ロドリゴ,char_517]
The job of the vigilante group is to protect everyone in the village.
No matter if it's in another world or anywhere,
We, the vigilante group, will protect everyone in the village!
------------------------------------------------
[00000204][ロドリゴ,char_517]
I'll show you the true power of the vigilante group!
------------------------------------------------
[00000205][ダニエル,char_518]
It is true that Panis does many things for the village.
Thank you for your hard work...
Let's take a closer look.
------------------------------------------------
[00000206][ダニエル,char_518]
For the animals and for the family.
Of course I will do my best for Panis!
------------------------------------------------
[00000207][ダニエル,char_518]
Especially for Peter as a father.
I have to show you my good side!
------------------------------------------------
[00000208][ダニエル,char_518]
I have to save Panis' family and friends.
If the child's loved ones are
Because he is equally important to us.
------------------------------------------------
[00000209][ブレンダ,char_519]
That's right.
That kind Panis-chan,
He can't be a bad boy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000210][ブレンダ,char_519]
I'm sure it's something
I wonder if there's something serious going on...
------------------------------------------------
[00000211][ブレンダ,char_519]
Just as we value everyone in our village,
Panis-chan also thinks about the people of her hometown.
I think it's important...it's only natural.
------------------------------------------------
[00000212][ブレンダ,char_519]
To save her loved ones,
I'll do whatever I can to help!
------------------------------------------------
[00000213][ブレンダ,char_519]
We're finally heading to another world.
Me, Daniel, Peter, and the animals.
I'll do my best to convey my feelings!
------------------------------------------------
[00000214][ピーター,char_520]
Yes, I'm looking forward to it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000215][ピーター,char_520]
Do you have time to see animals?
------------------------------------------------
[00000216][ピーター,char_520]
We're not going out to play, are we?
------------------------------------------------
[00000217][ピーター,char_520]
What kind of animals are there in another world?
I'm looking forward to it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000218][ピーター,char_520]
What kind of sheep or chicken do you think Freed is?
……yeah? You don't know if there are any animals, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000219][ピーター,char_520]
Hmm, I'm really looking forward to it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000220][ピーター,char_520]
Oh, that's right.
I'm going to save the world of Panis.
Sorry, I was getting carried away.
------------------------------------------------
[00000221][ピーター,char_520]
But, after defeating the "Doomsday Titan"...
Can I just take a look at the animals?
------------------------------------------------
[00000222][ピーター,char_520]
Sorry, Freed...
I'm not going out to play,
I knew it too, but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000223][ピーター,char_520]
...Maybe Freed too
Have you ever wondered what he is like?
------------------------------------------------
[00000224][ピーター,char_520]
If the animals believe in Panis,
I guess I'll try believing in Panis too.
Animals can see into people's hearts.
------------------------------------------------
[00000225][ピーター,char_520]
I will also be happy to cooperate!
Panis took good care of the animals,
I have to give something back!
------------------------------------------------
[00000226][ピーター,char_520]
So the ship is ready?
Maybe it's because we all worked hard,
It ended quite quickly, didn't it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000227][ピーター,char_520]
Let's all cooperate
It feels so good!
------------------------------------------------
[00000228][ラナ,char_528]
They're both panis, so you can't compare them.
------------------------------------------------
[00000229][ラナ,char_528]
No, I don't like it or anything like that...
------------------------------------------------
[00000230][ラナ,char_528]
If anything, the former one is...
------------------------------------------------
[00000231][ラナ,char_528]
Panis, the atmosphere has changed quite a bit.
...Hey, Freed?
Which do you prefer, the current Panis or the old Panis?
------------------------------------------------
[00000232][ラナ,char_528]
Oh my, that's a lot to say!
He totally showed off!
Hot, hot!　Hyuuuuuuuu!
------------------------------------------------
[00000233][ラナ,char_528]
Freed, stay friends with Panis forever!
------------------------------------------------
[00000234][ラナ,char_528]
Well, if you say it seems like Freed,
That's a reasonable answer...
That's totally no good!
------------------------------------------------
[00000235][ラナ,char_528]
Okay, Freed?
If you don't say it clearly,
Girls get anxious, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000236][ラナ,char_528]
Colla! Freed!
If you say anything more, I'll tell Shannon!
If Panis heard that, he would be sad!
------------------------------------------------
[00000237][ラナ,char_528]
……picture? That's right, sorry...
------------------------------------------------
[00000238][ラナ,char_528]
Well, you don't have to worry about it that seriously...
Sorry, I heard something strange.
------------------------------------------------
[00000239][ラナ,char_528]
You can see that the atmosphere of the village has changed!
I'd say it's getting closer to how it was before.
It looks like everyone's bond has returned!
------------------------------------------------
[00000240][ラナ,char_528]
Freed, it's time to take a breather!
Fight~!
------------------------------------------------
[00000241][ラナ,char_528]
The village has become one again!
If there's anything I can do,
I'll help you with anything, so don't hesitate to ask!
------------------------------------------------
[00000242][ラナ,char_528]
Don't worry about this,
Do your best to save Panis!
------------------------------------------------
[00000243][ラナ,char_528]
Freed, no matter what,
Never give up!?
------------------------------------------------
