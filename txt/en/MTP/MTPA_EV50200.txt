[00000000][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
The animals are over there.
We are so stiff and huddled together,
What are you doing?
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Looks like you're being attacked by a monster.
They stick together in groups to protect themselves.
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Before taking the animals home,
We have to do something about that monster first.
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Let's get this over with quickly.
Let's go!
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Did you manage to get rid of the monsters?
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It looks like the animals are safe too.
All that's left to do is take them back to the village.
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Now I can finally bake bread!
Let's go home early.
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][フリード,char_001 Fried]
There are so many monsters today.
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
But I have to take care of them first.
I can't get lumber.
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
This is where Freed comes in.
Since there are so many opponents, we have to work hard.
Go ahead and do it like someday.
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Eh? Do I have to do it?
That's tiring...
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Hahaha. Well, that's it.
Use the power of example to live up to Shannon's expectations.
I don't think it will decrease.
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It can't be helped.
Well then, let's try it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I finally got it done...
I'm tired...
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Well done, Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
There's no time to rest, Freed!
We all carry lumber,
Help out too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Are you still working?
Let me rest for a while...
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed is amazing!
Freed just now was so cool!
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, really? Thank you, Panis.
If you say that,
I suddenly feel better.
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Alright, let's get excited and move the lumber!
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
The presence of seeds was confirmed.
We will now move on to the collection work.
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][フリード,char_001 Fried]
hang on!
Monsters are roaming around.
I have to take care of that first.
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Clean up...Is this cleaning work?
That work is not scheduled.
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Cleaning up has a different meaning.
This kid takes everything in stride.
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][パニス,char_002 Panis]
It's dangerous when there are monsters,
That means we'll beat him, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Such that.
Adam, got it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I have confirmed the instructions.
Now let's move on to eliminating monsters.
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Eliminate monsters.
The surrounding area has been secured.
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Now you can collect seeds with confidence.
Adam, let's start.
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Adam, let's go home with a lot!
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I got it.
Seed collection work begins.
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What a battle to steal the country!
This island doesn't belong to anyone, but
If you want to rule by force, that's a different story!
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I won't let you do what you want!
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Haha, I'm feeling good today too.
You guys have to be like that.
At least let me have fun!
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Come on, let's go!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
There are many injured people...
Is it about time?
We can't afford to hold back on doing everything we can.
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Reserve troops, move to the flank!
Sanitation team! Send the injured away!
The rest follow me!
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oops! Damn... that Levin guy.
He always outsmarts me...
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
ah. He commanded an army somewhere.
I don't know if there is.
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Even the way you use words is sometimes elegant.
Rumor has it that he was some prince.
Maybe it's true after all?
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hmm...I guess so...
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I managed to win...
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
It looks like they managed to protect the island somehow.
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hehe...that's right. Not this time.
But I can't believe I'm going to give up at this point.
It's better not to even dream about it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's the same thing if I come again!
No matter how many times or dozens of times, I'll drive you back and show you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hahahahaha!　You say it!
I'll be back again, boy!
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed.
What is Gakko fix Zairyo?
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][フリード,char_001 Fried]
When asked what kind of thing it is...
Ordinary wood is fine, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Not just any tree is fine.
Trees that are thick, straight, and have few branches are best.
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Understood. But monsters are in the way.
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
The outlook is not effective here,
Even if you defeat them, your friends will return immediately.
It's a difficult place to fight.
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Well then, let's get to the monsters.
Let's clean it up!
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Zynga, isn't this a safe way to search?
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That's right.
Okay, let's collect wood to fix the school.
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I got it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Do you really want to fight...
it can not be helped.
Everyone, let's go!
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Ou!
If the other party is interested, there is no need to hold back.
I'll crush you all at once!
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Oh no, not anymore.
Please don't look so scary, please?
You can't be serious about crushing me, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
...What?
What are you talking about?
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
If you get serious, I'll be in trouble.
This is a weak girl...
I want you to be a little kinder...
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
If you are kind to me,
My sister is here,
I wish I could tell you...
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I-is that a good thing...?
Zynga? What is a good thing...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Don't shake it at me!
Even if you ask me, what is that...
in trouble!
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Wait a minute, both of you!
Why are you stretching the area under your nose?
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That woman didn't set it up for me!
Just because you said something sweet,
I'm not in a good mood!
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Ah, that was a nice place.
Boys are good listeners,
Girls are just a hindrance.
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What is that!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It seems like any further conversation is useless.
Let's start early.
I'll forcefully ask you what I want to hear!
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Ah, I lost.
That's it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Did you realize?
If you learn from this, you'll never come again!
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Oh, that's not going to happen.
This is just a greeting.
I'll bother you as many times as I want until I get my "power".
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I also realized that you guys have a gap,
That's enough for this time.
It won't happen next time, so be prepared.
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
So noisy!
I told you not to come again!
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Sister, I'm already gone.
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But what did he mean by "power"?
I'm a little concerned...
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is this the ruins that the village chief was talking about...
It's kind of a strange atmosphere.
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Indeed, no matter what is hidden
It's not strange.
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Ah! Look at that! What is that!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No way... a giant!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
yeah……? You guys, calm down.
That's just a stone statue.
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Huh? Is that so?
...Oh, that's true.
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I was surprised……
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][フリード,char_001 Fried]
If you look closely, you'll see that it's just a stone statue.
It's pretty big, but not as big as that giant.
------------------------------------------------
[00000083][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But I can't find anything else noteworthy.
Shall we take a closer look?
------------------------------------------------
[00000084][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
...Hey, Freed.
Let's leave that for later.
That doesn't seem to be the case right now.
------------------------------------------------
[00000085][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Ah, it certainly seems like that.
That monster is aiming for us.
------------------------------------------------
[00000086][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I thought he would leave if I didn't provoke him, but
It didn't work out that way.
------------------------------------------------
[00000087][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I can't help it! Let's chase them away!
------------------------------------------------
[00000088][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Phew...
Somehow you were able to defeat the monsters.
------------------------------------------------
[00000089][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It's a relief.
But I can't let my guard down.
Maybe he'll come back with some friends.
------------------------------------------------
[00000090][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But it looks like it'll be fine for a while.
Let's investigate the ruins now.
------------------------------------------------
[00000091][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
There's a cannon here too.
I think I can go this time!
------------------------------------------------
[00000092][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Last time I wasn't able to plan properly,
That won't happen this time!
------------------------------------------------
[00000093][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
No matter how strong he is,
There must be a gap somewhere.
If you find that one, you can win!
------------------------------------------------
[00000094][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
It means the enemy's weakness.
I will analyze...
------------------------------------------------
[00000095][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
...The ring-shaped object that exists on the enemy's head is
It seems to have a higher energy response than other parts.
If there is a weakness, it would be in this area.
------------------------------------------------
[00000096][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That ring on your head.
It's unlikely that a normal attack will reach you, but
I wonder if a cannon would be able to reach it somehow.
------------------------------------------------
[00000097][フリード,char_001 Fried]
If we all work together, we can definitely win!
Everyone, let's go!
Defeat him and protect the village!
------------------------------------------------
[00000098][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Shit, it still doesn't work!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000099][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Calm down!
There are no absolutes in this world.
Even that giant has a chance!
------------------------------------------------
[00000100][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I'm curious about the ring-shaped object on the head.
Try concentrating your attacks on that area.
------------------------------------------------
[00000101][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Maybe...it's working!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000102][フリード,char_001 Fried]
After all, that's the weak point.
Everyone, concentrate your attacks!
------------------------------------------------
[00000103][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Okay, how about this!
------------------------------------------------
[00000104][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Changes can be seen throughout the enemy's body.
It seems that resistance to physical attacks has been reduced.
------------------------------------------------
[00000105][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Does that mean you can attack properly?
------------------------------------------------
[00000106][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Everyone, take a breather!
Let's join forces and defeat him!
------------------------------------------------
[00000107][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
The enemy has gone completely silent.
------------------------------------------------
[00000108][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I did it...I did it!
I finally defeated the giant!
------------------------------------------------
[00000109][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Yay, hey!
Freed, you're a big deal!
I believed you could do it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000110][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's not just me, it's all thanks to everyone's cooperation.
Zynga, Adam, Shannon, Panis,
Thank you so much everyone!
------------------------------------------------
[00000111][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
fault……?
...What about Panis?
Hey, does anyone know where Panis went?
------------------------------------------------
