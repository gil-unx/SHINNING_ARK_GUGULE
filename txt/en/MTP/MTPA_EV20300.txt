@fcFFAAFFAA (Kill Maria-san is always
It feels like you're rushing me, but what are you doing? )
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Mr. Freed, would you like to help me?
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, I was wondering what he was doing.
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
It's already decided! Heaven and earth
In the name of justice, to save the people of the world,
He continues to chase the demons he must exorcise day and night!
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][フリード,char_001 Fried]
eh? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
There is no time for an exorcist to rest.
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's right...
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Mr. Kilmaria, may I ask you a question?
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I don't mind, but I'm busy.
Please be brief.
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's not that difficult a question.
Well, to begin with, the Exorcist is
What kind of thing is it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Don't you even know that?!
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Somehow, I don't understand,
Since it's a great opportunity, I'll be working with Kill Maria, my real job.
I thought it would be nice to hear it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
It is inevitable. An exorcist is a person who travels between heaven and earth to save the people of the world.
A priest who exorcises evil in the name of Justice.
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I know that but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Here's what's important! It's easy to say, but
To actually exorcise evil requires a high level of ability.
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
In order to acquire this ability, daily rigorous training and
It is necessary to absorb a wide range of knowledge.
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][フリード,char_001 Fried]
for example?
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
When investigating ruins, it is important to understand the history behind them.
I have to learn and
To do this, you must also be able to read ancient texts.
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
There is also a need to learn all languages, including ancient scripts,
No matter how much time I have, it's not enough,
I have something to learn!
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's so difficult.
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
That's not all.
This is just a preparatory stage.
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
When I hear that the devil has appeared, I cross the mountains and the sea,
If you hear information about the ruins, you can reach the ends of the earth.
I have to travel.
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
In between these duties,
I am training and learning.
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][フリード,char_001 Fried]
By the way, what kind of evil have you exorcised so far?
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Well, most recently, I've created a pitch black dragon.
You defeated it. It was quite a big deal, but
If it hits me, bang! and……
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Wow!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Wow! Bang Bang!
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Uh, you don't have to shoot!
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Is that so? I'm sorry.
I thought this would give a more realistic feel.
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
...Well, how much did we talk about?
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Ah, I've got the gist of it now, so it's okay now.
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
is that so?
I want everyone to understand correctly,
I'll tell you as much as I want.
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Wouldn't you rather keep it short because you're busy?)
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
something?
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, it's really okay now. thank you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
That would be great. all the best.
I have a continuation of my investigation...
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Well, I don't really understand it, but
I'm sure he's an amazing person anyway.
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah. Bang bang!
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is that there...
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hi!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Wow! Even Panis could do it!
Bang bang!
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, hey!
Isn't that Kill Maria's two-handed pistol?
Why Panis!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Kill Maria left it there.
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Did you leave it there?
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Wow...I forgot this here!
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Kill Maria!
Don't forget this dangerous thing!
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I'm sorry for what I did.
all the best.
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][フリード,char_001 Fried]
So, a handgun!
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Ah, that's right!
I did receive it. It is all right now!
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is it amazing or not amazing?
This is a person I don't really understand...
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hello, Kilmaria.
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Mr. Kilmaria?
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I'm reading a book.
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's amazing concentration.
Even if you call me, you won't even notice...
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Kill Maria!
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I just keep reading books...
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
……devil!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][フリード,char_001 Fried]
eh!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yay, bang!
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
What, Mr. Freed and Mr. Panis?
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hey, don't point that at me!
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
No, what do you mean by "devil"?
Because that's what I heard.
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Did you say that?
In the first place, Killmaria-san was concentrating on reading,
You didn't notice even if I called you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
When I read a book, I tend to get absorbed in it,
When you hear the word "devil", you instantly switch to battle mode.
Don't worry, we're training you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (I feel rather anxious though...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][パニス,char_002 Panis]
What are you reading in your book?
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Is this?
This is an old document called ``Optimizing efficiency and fairness.''
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
To put it simply, to improve the efficiency of things,
This is a practical book that condenses the knowledge of the ancients.
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][フリード,char_001 Fried]
The exorcist is
Do I have to study like that?
It's tough.
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
No, well, what can I say...
If you hurry, it will be Justice,
I'm reading it on a whim.
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Huh, what does that mean?
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
In the first place, ancient chants were written.
I was reading another ancient text.
Well...this is it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...No matter how I look at it, it doesn't seem like I can read it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Of course.
Even I had a hard time reading it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Moreover, this content was a parade of difficult questions.
It takes seven days to master a song.
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It seems like it would be really difficult, but
After that, I memorized the song,
Is there anything good?
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yes, that's it already!
This song is essential to my justice.
It is a song of purification that exorcises evil with its strong power!
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
That's where this book on efficiency comes in.
If you don't master it as soon as possible,
The devil won't wait for you when the time comes.
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I see, it's a study to memorize efficiently.
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
yes. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
If reading is too difficult,
Mastering the art of efficiency is even more difficult.
I've been working on this ancient document for the past 10 days.
------------------------------------------------
[00000083][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Huh?
------------------------------------------------
[00000084][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
This is all a test to exorcise evil through song.
I'll never be discouraged though.
------------------------------------------------
[00000085][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I can only sleep 3 hours a day,
It's crazy to think it's for Justice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000086][フリード,char_001 Fried]
……yeah?
------------------------------------------------
[00000087][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
What's happen?
------------------------------------------------
[00000088][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It takes 10 days to master efficiency, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000089][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
yes.
------------------------------------------------
[00000090][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It takes 7 days to master a song, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000091][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
yes.
------------------------------------------------
[00000092][フリード,char_001 Fried]
If so, wouldn't it be faster to learn songs normally?
------------------------------------------------
[00000093][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
eh? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000094][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Ah!! It will take an extra 3 days!
------------------------------------------------
[00000095][フリード,char_001 Fried]
If you can master singing in an instant by improving efficiency,
It only takes 3 days, but if you can only shorten it by 1 day or 2 days,
It might cost more.
------------------------------------------------
[00000096][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Wow...I completely overlooked that.
What shall I do!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000097][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
When I, Justice, flash,
When you can't see your surroundings and run away,
It's my only weakness...
------------------------------------------------
[00000098][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (...the only one?)
------------------------------------------------
[00000099][パニス,char_002 Panis]
How about reading a song book normally?
------------------------------------------------
[00000100][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
……I agree. I can no longer afford to take detours.
Master the purification song head-on!
------------------------------------------------
[00000101][フリード,char_001 Fried]
All I can say is good luck...
------------------------------------------------
[00000102][パニス,char_002 Panis]
It seems like I can't hear you anymore.
------------------------------------------------
[00000103][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000104][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's true.
------------------------------------------------
[00000105][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000106][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Even if you don't think about efficiency, if you have this concentration,
It seems like everything can be done in a short period of time.
------------------------------------------------
[00000107][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000108][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hello, Kilmaria.
what happened?
------------------------------------------------
[00000109][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Ah, Mr. Freed...
Even if you are just trying to master the chants, you are wasting your precious time.
It's such a shame that I wasted it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000110][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Even if you don't feel so depressed, take a detour
Isn't it good to think that you have learned how to be more efficient?
------------------------------------------------
[00000111][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
...As expected, Mr. Freed is so positive!
As you say.
------------------------------------------------
[00000112][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
If I am also depressed
There was no. I will do my best in the name of heaven, earth, and justice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000113][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's the spirit.
------------------------------------------------
[00000114][ロラン,char_507]
Freed! It's a big deal!
A monster appeared in the forest!
------------------------------------------------
[00000115][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What did you say!?
Did the children go to the forest alone?
------------------------------------------------
[00000116][ロラン,char_507]
I thought it was okay because it wasn't that deep.
We all went to get food...
------------------------------------------------
[00000117][フリード,char_001 Fried]
So, everyone is still in the forest!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000118][ロラン,char_507]
Climb the tree and wait for the monster to go...
------------------------------------------------
[00000119][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hey, I'll call Jinga and the others!
------------------------------------------------
[00000120][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I don't have time for that!
Let's go help right away!
That's what Justice is whispering!
------------------------------------------------
[00000121][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I didn't really understand the meaning of the last one, but
I definitely have to hurry...let's go!
------------------------------------------------
[00000122][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Killmaria-san, is that song from the other day...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000123][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
yes. I'm glad I mastered it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000124][フリード,char_001 Fried]
As expected, that's what happened.
If you didn't cleanse me with chants, I would have been in danger...
------------------------------------------------
[00000125][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Kill Maria, you sing very well.
------------------------------------------------
[00000126][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
That's my song,
It's still not as good as Panis's.
------------------------------------------------
[00000127][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I can't believe Kilmaria's efforts are paying off so quickly.
It was really good.
------------------------------------------------
[00000128][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
No, it's all thanks to Mr. Freed. Mr. Freed
If you don't realize my mistake,
Moreover, he had just wasted days.
------------------------------------------------
[00000129][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Besides, I can survive this place.
It may have been impossible...
------------------------------------------------
[00000130][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Well, the result is okay, isn't it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000131][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Mr. Freed is truly positive.
But I should humbly reflect...
------------------------------------------------
[00000132][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Why?
------------------------------------------------
[00000133][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I heard that children were in danger.
I couldn't help but run away...
------------------------------------------------
[00000134][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
If you think about it carefully,
It would be better if Zynga and others also lend a hand,
It might have been safer and more reliable...
------------------------------------------------
[00000135][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
What kind of monsters are there and how many are there?
I came here without checking,
If large things were attacking in large numbers...
------------------------------------------------
[00000136][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Not just these kids, but me too.
Mr. Freed and Mr. Panis,
I might have been beaten...
------------------------------------------------
[00000137][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Well, that may have been the case...
but……
------------------------------------------------
[00000138][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I believe in Mr. Freed's positive thinking and
Calm situational judgment in sudden situations
I would love to learn from you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000139][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
The road to becoming a top-notch exorcist is still only halfway.
------------------------------------------------
[00000140][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I think Kilmaria is still top notch, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000141][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
eh!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000142][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Kilmaria is
I think it's fine for Kilmaria to remain as she is now.
------------------------------------------------
[00000143][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
……why?
------------------------------------------------
[00000144][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It is very difficult to act before thinking.
I think so. Make excuses to others or yourself
It's better to be able to move than not to move at all.
------------------------------------------------
[00000145][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
……is that so?
------------------------------------------------
[00000146][メリー,char_509]
Kill Maria is going to bang right away!
I like it because it does that!
------------------------------------------------
[00000147][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000148][フリード,char_001 Fried]
you see. I might not have made it in time if I hadn't rushed.
Kill Maria's justice was right!
------------------------------------------------
[00000149][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I wish you could say something like that...
thank you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000150][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hey, bang bang, do it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000151][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
OK. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000152][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Wow!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000153][パニス,char_002 Panis]
yay! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000154][メリー,char_509]
Bang bang!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000155][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
One more bonus...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000156][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Stop it! It's dangerous!
------------------------------------------------
[00000157][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Ah, sorry...
What I did just happened...
------------------------------------------------
[00000158][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Kill Maria is a first-rate exorcist, but
I guess I'm missing something,
There's one more thing that makes the filling feel sweet...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000159][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000160][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hello, Kilmaria.
------------------------------------------------
[00000161][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Ah, Mr. Freed...
------------------------------------------------
[00000162][フリード,char_001 Fried]
You don't seem to be feeling well, what's wrong?　
------------------------------------------------
[00000163][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Actually, Mr. Freed,
He has something he would like to discuss with you...
------------------------------------------------
[00000164][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, if I can help you
Can I ask you anything?
------------------------------------------------
[00000165][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Mr. Freed, what should I do?
You can change your careless behavior, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000166][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Being able to take action before thinking
It's Killmaria's specialty,
Didn't they say it was okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000167][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
After all, that’s no good!
At that time, I ended up getting carried away and banging!
I messed up...
------------------------------------------------
[00000168][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Haha, that was definitely dangerous.
Well, the kids were happy too, so I guess it's okay.
------------------------------------------------
[00000169][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis was also fun!
------------------------------------------------
[00000170][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
yes……
But after that, I fell into a lot of self-loathing...
------------------------------------------------
[00000171][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
If we continue like this, we will make an irreversible mistake someday.
I'm afraid I'll do something...
------------------------------------------------
[00000172][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hmm...
------------------------------------------------

@fcFFAAFFAA (I think it would be better to fix it if it can be fixed)
In Killmaria's case, you could say that she is naturally reckless...
I don't think it's something that can be fixed by trying to fix it.)
------------------------------------------------
[00000174][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
That face...it looks like it's impossible.
------------------------------------------------
[00000175][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What!?...No, no, that's not true!
Kill Maria is a hard worker, so she will definitely change!
------------------------------------------------
[00000176][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Wow, I just said something random...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000177][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
This time, I said, “Oh no, I said something random.”
That's what you said on your face.
------------------------------------------------
[00000178][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, that's not true!
------------------------------------------------
[00000179][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (How sharp, Kill Maria...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000180][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Well, then, Mr. Kilmaria,
Let's explore the cause together.
------------------------------------------------
[00000181][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Is it the cause?
------------------------------------------------
[00000182][フリード,char_001 Fried]
yes. He's also smart, much better than me.
You should be able to do a calm analysis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000183][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But why do you act so rashly?
Let's explore the cause together.
------------------------------------------------
[00000184][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I see, that's Justice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000185][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...I think that's it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000186][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
……teeth?
------------------------------------------------
[00000187][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's why, Mr. Kilmaria,
I say "Justice" every time...
------------------------------------------------
[00000188][フリード,char_001 Fried]
To that “Justice”
Isn't it bad to follow too much?
------------------------------------------------
[00000189][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
What so? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000190][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Absolutely...
First of all, what is “Justice”?
------------------------------------------------
[00000191][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Well, it's like a revelation from God, isn't it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000192][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Is it something that has that much weight?
Looking at Kill Maria's actions,
Rather, "intuition" seems more appropriate...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000193][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But, if it's absolute "God's revelation",
There can be no mistakes, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000194][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
that's right.
Countless dangerous situations,
I've avoided it thanks to Justice.
------------------------------------------------
[00000195][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But there were some things that couldn't be avoided, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000196][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Things that could not be avoided with Justice
there is no!
------------------------------------------------
[00000197][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is that so?
Indeed, according to Justice
He also helped children...
------------------------------------------------
[00000198][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Saying things like, “Hurry up, Justice.”
Trying to memorize chants efficiently,
There were times when it took a long time, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000199][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Hah... now that I think about it!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000200][フリード,char_001 Fried]
you see?
Without realizing it, Justin
Maybe it backfired?
------------------------------------------------
[00000201][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (in the case of Kill Maria,
Maybe that makes me look clumsy...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000202][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
But then, my Justice is
Does that mean it's definitely not the case?
------------------------------------------------
[00000203][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Well, the truth is, I don't even know.
Because, to Mr. Kill Maria's Justice,
There are times when I can be helped...
------------------------------------------------
[00000204][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I'm getting more and more confused...
------------------------------------------------
[00000205][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I guess that's what it is after all?
Kill Maria also still has Justice.
Have you ever felt like you don't really understand?
------------------------------------------------
[00000206][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
eh!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000207][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Mr. Kilmaria misinterpreted Justice,
She seems to have been acting without realizing it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000208][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
My sense of justice is lacking...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000209][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is that so...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000210][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I see, if that's the case...
There are still many things that he lacks as an exorcist.
Since it's me, I totally agree.
------------------------------------------------
[00000211][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Then, the challenge to change careless behavior is:
Judiciary raise your eyes,
That's all there is to it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000212][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Who am I, “Justice”?
I'm going to think about it again from the beginning.
------------------------------------------------
[00000213][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Good luck, Kilmaria.
------------------------------------------------
[00000214][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000215][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Cheer up, Kilmaria.
Are you still worried about Justice?
------------------------------------------------
[00000216][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
In fact, I have a sense of justice for Mr. Freed.
Ever since my inexperience was pointed out, I have relied on him until now.
I completely lost confidence in Justice...
------------------------------------------------
[00000217][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (because of what I said)
Did they corner Kill Maria? )
------------------------------------------------
[00000218][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
But now, my Justice,
A great threat is approaching this island.
I'm telling you...
------------------------------------------------
[00000219][フリード,char_001 Fried]
eh!?
Isn't that a big deal...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000220][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I think so.
However, I couldn't take action with confidence...
------------------------------------------------
[00000221][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Kill Maria-san!! What happened!?
It's not like Kill Maria to say something like that!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000222][パニス,char_002 Panis]
that's right! Let's go, Kill Maria!
------------------------------------------------
[00000223][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
What!? Even Mr. Panis...
But...
------------------------------------------------
[00000224][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Kill Maria! believe in yourself!
We believe in Kill Maria!
Let's go!! Which one?
------------------------------------------------
[00000225][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
……got it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000226][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I……
to my justice
It’s okay to be confident, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000227][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah, of course.
------------------------------------------------
[00000228][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
...Actually, I am thinking about my former Panis-san.
Even Justice was worried.
------------------------------------------------
[00000229][パニス,char_002 Panis]
What's wrong with Panis?
------------------------------------------------
[00000230][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
My Justice started with Mr. Panis.
I decided it was the devil...
------------------------------------------------
[00000231][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
In the sense of being an entity that brings disaster to Endias,
The result was not wrong, but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000232][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
After that, taking into consideration various information and circumstances,
It was also determined that Mr. Panis was not a devil.
I am still convinced that he was not wrong.
------------------------------------------------
[00000233][フリード,char_001 Fried]
……I agree.
Both were correct Justices.
------------------------------------------------
[00000234][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Killmaria's Justice is
It's always right.
------------------------------------------------
[00000235][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
……yes. I have come to believe that too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000236][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
And because of Mr. Panis,
I also learned something important.
------------------------------------------------
[00000237][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
That is me,
How do you judge Justice and take action?
It all depends on it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000238][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yes, I think that's right.
You're finally starting to look like the usual Killmaria.
------------------------------------------------
[00000239][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
It's all thanks to Mr. Freed!
I can't thank you enough!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000240][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Well, what am I...
------------------------------------------------
[00000241][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
My Justice is because of Mr. Freed.
Double or triple that power...
No, I think it can be made a hundred or a thousand times more!
------------------------------------------------
[00000242][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, that's it...
Even without me, Killmaria-san
I can make full use of Justice.
------------------------------------------------
[00000243][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Don't be humble!
I need Mr. Freed's help!
------------------------------------------------
[00000244][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
How about? Would you like to explore the path of an exorcist?
------------------------------------------------
[00000245][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, I don't even have that kind of talent.
I don't have a shred of sense...
------------------------------------------------
[00000246][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
That's not true! Possibly……
No, I'm sure you'll be a better exorcist than me.
You can get used to it! You can't go wrong with Freed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000247][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I've already bought it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000248][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I will be waiting for you forever!
With Mr. Freed, in the name of Justice
I look forward to the day when we can wipe out evil!
------------------------------------------------
[00000249][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
all the best!
------------------------------------------------
[00000250][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Phew, I have a personality that rushes into action whenever I think of something.
Same as always...
------------------------------------------------
[00000251][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Wow!! Why!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000252][パニス,char_002 Panis]
It was falling.
------------------------------------------------
[00000253][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Killmaria-san, did you forget again!?
That's why you can't shoot Panis without permission!
------------------------------------------------
[00000254][フリード,char_001 Fried]
So don't shoot!
------------------------------------------------
[00000255][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Because it's fun.
------------------------------------------------
[00000256][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hey, Kill Maria!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000257][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Mr. Freed! You've made up your mind!
I'm so happy!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000258][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's different! lost item!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000259][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
eh!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000260][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Ahhh... that's what I did!
------------------------------------------------
[00000261][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Is it really amazing or not amazing?
He's the one who doesn't understand until the end...)
