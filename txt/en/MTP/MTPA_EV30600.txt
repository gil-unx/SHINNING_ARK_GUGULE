Freed was just right.
I have something to ask of you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][ハイラム,char_513]
It's a festival, so it would be bad if we didn't decorate it grandly, right?
But we don't have enough lumber.
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][ハイラム,char_513]
I'm sorry, but go to the forest of giant trees.
Could you please bring it for me?
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][フリード,char_001 Fried]
yep, OK.
Wait for me, I'll get it for you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][ハイラム,char_513]
Thank you, Freed.
Thanks to you, I was saved.
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][ハイラム,char_513]
The decorations for this festival are
I'm trying to create something that's never been seen before.
Please look forward to it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][ダニエル,char_518]
Freed.
If you are free, could you ask me to work for you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][ダニエル,char_518]
At the festival,
I want to serve delicious whole roast to everyone.
But we don't have enough wild pig meat.
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][ダニエル,char_518]
It would be helpful if you could just go to the plains and get it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Understood! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][ダニエル,char_518]
Oh, did you bring it for me? thank you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][ダニエル,char_518]
The festival is coming soon.
My son is also fidgety now.
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][フリード,char_001 Fried]
After all, it's a festival.
Well, everyone is looking forward to it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][ダニエル,char_518]
Haha, that's true too.
It's been a while since I've been to a festival, so let's enjoy it to the fullest!
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah!
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][リアン,char_514]
here we go! We also bake special bread!
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][リアン,char_514]
Freed, go to the plateau,
Please fetch me some elven berries.
Bread for festivals definitely needs that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][フリード,char_001 Fried]
At this time of year, there seem to be a lot of them.
Okay, I'll go.
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][リアン,char_514]
good job. With this much, you can make a lot of bread.
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][リアン,char_514]
here we go! After all, I have to use my skills in times like this!
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's been a long time since my aunt baked bread.
You can eat it, right? I am looking forward!
