Uncle, what happened?
You look troubled.
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][ハイラム,char_513]
No, I'm talking about the only fishing boat in the village.
Apparently the sail was torn due to the incident with the giant.
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][ハイラム,char_513]
Even though Zynga has asked me to fix it,
I don't have Katameft cotton fabric to use as a material.
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][ハイラム,char_513]
How to make Katameft Cotton
I need Katameft cotton flowers,
That is not cultivated in the village.
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Isn't it growing somewhere?
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][ハイラム,char_513]
There must have been a colony in the forest,
It's dangerous around there.
I don't have much confidence in fighting so it's a bit...
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What, if that's the case,
I'll go and get it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][ハイラム,char_513]
Really? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Leave it to me.
Well then, I'll go for a while.
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][ハイラム,char_513]
Thank you, Freed.
Thanks to you guys for bringing the Katamefuto cotton.
I was able to repair the sail.
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][ハイラム,char_513]
Now you can move the ship,
You can catch more delicious fish.
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][ジム,char_502]
We met at just the right place, Freed!
We met here, but what the heck!
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][ジム,char_502]
shut up! I can't make you look cool!
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][ジム,char_502]
Look!
I'll exterminate the monsters by myself!
And get Zynga's big brother to approve!
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][ジム,char_502]
From now on, I will protect this village!
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hmm...
Is it okay...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed...
Jim, isn't it dangerous?
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree.
Let's be a little careful.
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Jim, that was a dangerous place.
Are you okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][ジム,char_502]
"Are you okay?" "What are you saying?"
I'm not in any danger at all!
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][ジム,char_502]
I couldn't handle something like that on my own!
That's completely unnecessary!
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][ジム,char_502]
Listen! Next time I'll defeat it by myself!
I'm the one who protects this village! I understand!
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Hmm...
I understand how you feel about the village...)
