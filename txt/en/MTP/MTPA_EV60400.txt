[00000000][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
If we all work together, we'll be fine.
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Well, let's do our best.
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Yes, it's tough...
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I need to strengthen my ship, I need to learn how to fight, etc.
Something has become important...
Naval battles are tough...
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I have to work hard and be able to fight well!
I can't lose to pirates!
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's right. This is not the time to complain.
Let's do our best, Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Stay strong, Freed!
Don't let it get to you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
After all, I have to be strong.
Yes Yes.
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Why, don't look so worried.
Everything has worked out until now,
It's nothing more than learning how to fight!
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
remember? We used to go into the wheat fields and play.
And my father always scolded me...
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Wait, Freed!?
I trust Velvet too much
I don't think it's good!
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
like Bacchus
If you are deceived and thrown away,
What to do!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
The wind that flows from that rocky mountain,
It was very cold, really cold.
Mr. Kilmaria, can you do something about that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Anyway, once you're ready,
Let's go to Kilmaria.
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Mr. Kilmaria, what are you investigating?
Why don't you go and have a look?
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I don't think he's that bad of a person.
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I can't worry about that right now.
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It's better to have a clear personality like that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Velvet...she seems to have solid skills,
I don't like her personality...
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I'm afraid that things will continue to get tossed around somehow in the future.
I'm starting to feel anxious...will I be okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
If Freed thinks so,
He's probably not a bad guy at heart...
It looks like it's really strong.
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Well, while I was putting it together,
Maybe I'll start to see some good things.
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That's a realistic answer.
You are certainly right.
Nowadays, it's not a matter of personality.
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That's what I think, but I can't shake my anxiety.
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
……Really?
No, I am also someone who speaks clearly.
I don't hate it, but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
However, there is no limit to things...
I hope there won't be any trouble...
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
...Ah, I can't draw a conclusion that easily.
Well, let's wait and see.
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Someday, I'll catch a huge fish,
I want to catch it with just my power.
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Thanks to Velvet's help,
The way has opened for battle at sea.
It seems like he will be able to protect the village somehow.
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
If you feel even the slightest danger, do not force yourself.
Dare to turn back is the right choice.
It's the same as fishing.
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
The footage of those ruins...
After all, this island has secrets that we don't know.
It seems like it's still hidden.
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Yes, Velvet-san is also a member of the village.
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Let Adam decide.
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Isn't it still early?
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Mr. Freed, I would like to confirm one thing.
If you receive an order from Velvet,
Should I follow?
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
got it.
Now then, regarding Velvet-san's orders,
I'll try to follow it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
got it.
Although it is difficult to judge based on vague criteria,
I'll try as much as possible.
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
……is that so.
So, until Velvet officially becomes a member of the village,
I'll put it on hold.
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
However, Mr. Freed took care of Mr. Velvet.
It's a little disappointing that he sees it that way.
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Until I receive your reply,
This matter will be put on hold.
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
When there is no need for activity,
Sleep mode saves energy.
It's similar to human sleep.
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
The idea of ​​recruiting pirates as allies as a measure against naval warfare was
It wasn't in my thought process.
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
All the humans, especially Mr. Freed.
It's amazing how flexible your thinking is.
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
If I continued on up the rocky mountain,
My drive system froze,
I almost couldn't move...
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
That image I saw at the ruins...
It seems like it was recorded somewhere a long time ago...
However, I cannot search the data.
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
It would be helpful if Kilmaria-san could also help me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
You don't have to worry about that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Killmaria-san is only worried about herself.
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
This village is also full of pirates and monsters.
It's kind of difficult.
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
yes!When you are in trouble, please help each other!
I'll do my best together too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
is that so……
If Mr. Freed says so,
I can concentrate on my research with peace of mind.
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
……I agree.
An inexperienced person like me,
It was too much to worry about the village.
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
At the very least, I will not cause any inconvenience to you.
I'll be careful.
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
……sorry.
It seems like it was an unnecessary hassle.
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
There are so many things I want to research and not enough time.
Even if you try to cut down on your sleep time,
A living body naturally has its limits...
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Adam doesn't need to sleep,
I'm so jealous...
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Even so...
Why in the inscriptions of this island and the literature of the continent?
Is there a big discrepancy...
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
By investigating the differences thoroughly,
I feel like I know something...
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Please wait a moment while I look for something.
I'll have it ready by tomorrow.
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I have something that I would like to investigate carefully.
Could you please leave me alone for a while?
I think I'll know something by tomorrow.
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I hope you find the "strength".
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Tell me a lot about naval battles.
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Let's have fun.
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Well, a lot happened, but
For now, we've become friends.
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
In order to achieve mutual goals,
Let's do our best, shall we?
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Their naval skills are more important than me.
Worry about whether it will go up or not!
I wonder how friendly he really is...
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
However, I would like to thank you in advance.
thank you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It's a promise, so as far as I know,
I'll teach you properly...
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Whether you can master it or not
It's up to you guys.
Well, at least study hard.
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
...That's right. From now on, everyone
Aren't you saying let's go out and have some fun?
This is a deal, a deal. Recognize?
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
So much...
I don't feel this nervous so I guess it's okay.
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
……what happened?
Are you still wary of me?
Hey, it's okay. I won't betray you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
...For the time being, yeah.
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
This island is a very comfortable place to spend time.
The climate is mild and the food is delicious.
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Living in such a relaxing place,
Like you guys,
It's no wonder the weather is so bad...
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Freed...you're so funny.
I'm a little interested.
I want to know more about you ♪ Hehe ♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
...I'm sorry, but that potato bread...
I ate it and it was surprisingly delicious...
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
The wind and waves are making a strange noise.
Apparently, tomorrow is for the pirates.
Looks like it'll be a great time to make money.
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Freed, I've brought you an interesting story.
...What?
That's still a secret♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Please come again tomorrow.
Then I'll tell you♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Ahhh! It was a little more!
I hate things like this!
I feel like I'm being rushed and it's frustrating!
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I wonder what the video I saw at that ruins was?
I wonder if it has something to do with the "power" of the island...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][ガルゼー,char_501]
I also intend to do my best as the village chief, but
To those of you who actually go around the village every day,
I'm really grateful. thank you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000083][ガルゼー,char_501]
When it comes to the treatment of pirates, there are many different opinions.
However, it is the rule of this village to accept anyone, no matter who they are.
As long as it doesn't cause any harm.
------------------------------------------------
[00000084][ガルゼー,char_501]
Have you heard that pirates are coming to the cove?
He seems like a very troublesome person.
For the sake of the village, please get rid of them as soon as possible.
------------------------------------------------
[00000085][ジム,char_502]
It's okay because Jim is here!
------------------------------------------------
[00000086][ジム,char_502]
I think it's more reliable than Jim.
------------------------------------------------
[00000087][ジム,char_502]
I believe in Velvet.
------------------------------------------------
[00000088][ジム,char_502]
Recruiting pirates,
What on earth are you thinking?!
------------------------------------------------
[00000089][ジム,char_502]
There will definitely be some trouble!
Even if that happens, I don't know!
------------------------------------------------
[00000090][ジム,char_502]
Oh, that's right.
Hehe, you must understand, Freed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000091][ジム,char_502]
……yeah?That means if something happens,
Doesn't that mean it's my fault...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000092][ジム,char_502]
What!? In that case,
That female pirate is better than you.
I can really trust it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000093][ジム,char_502]
……that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000094][ジム,char_502]
What do you mean by “I believe”?
It's because you believe!
------------------------------------------------
[00000095][ジム,char_502]
Wow, what's going on with everyone in the village?
I was easily convinced by this guy's words,
They end up accepting pirates...
------------------------------------------------
[00000096][ジム,char_502]
Why are you silent? Are you worried now?
At best, you can panic until something happens!
------------------------------------------------
[00000097][ジム,char_502]
Jinga's big brother cares about the village more than anyone else,
Moreover, he is stronger than anyone else!
------------------------------------------------
[00000098][ジム,char_502]
Big brother is the right person to be the leader of the village!
Freed, don't get carried away!
------------------------------------------------
[00000099][ジム,char_502]
Is it sane to recruit pirates?
I don't know what will happen!
------------------------------------------------
[00000100][マイア,char_503]
I don't think Velvet is a bad person at all.
Jim seems worried...
------------------------------------------------
[00000101][マイア,char_503]
I made everyone worry, but
I'm completely fine now.
Thanks for the bread you delivered. thanks so much!
------------------------------------------------
[00000102][マイア,char_503]
When I delivered flowers to Alise-chan,
It made me very happy.
It was really good.
------------------------------------------------
[00000103][アリーゼ,char_504]
My father's adventure story...
Have you heard of it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000104][アリーゼ,char_504]
It's kind of popular, isn't it?
There are quite a few customers who are looking for that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000105][アリーゼ,char_504]
It's a problem for my father to go on an adventure, but...
The customers are looking forward to hearing about it.
It's hard to say not to go...
------------------------------------------------
[00000106][アリーゼ,char_504]
A girl pirate is coming this time, right?
Pirates seem to drink a lot!
I hope you come to the store...
------------------------------------------------
[00000107][アリーゼ,char_504]
Ah, but I guess it's no good because I'm a minor...
Well done...
------------------------------------------------
[00000108][アリーゼ,char_504]
It's the sweet potato from the "Elements of Power"...
The effects of that sweet potato are amazing!
If I cook it and serve it, will it sell?
------------------------------------------------
[00000109][アリーゼ,char_504]
I received some beautiful flowers from Maia-sensei!
You guys picked it too, right?
I'm so happy~Thank you very much~!
------------------------------------------------
[00000110][ダイアナ,char_505]
Hey, do you have recovery items ready...?
If you don't have it, you'll regret it during the battle...?
hehehehe……
------------------------------------------------
[00000111][ダイアナ,char_505]
You guys have become stronger...
Or is it thanks to that female pirate...?
Fufufufufu……
------------------------------------------------
[00000112][ドルトン,char_506]
If you think that I only make weapons, you are wrong.
We'll also make cannons, and we'll also modify and strengthen them.
------------------------------------------------
[00000113][ドルトン,char_506]
……yeah? No, should I call it a weapon...?
Well, don't worry about the details.
------------------------------------------------
[00000114][ドルトン,char_506]
I heard you chased Bacchus away.
Of course, he chased them away with his own weapon, right?
If you want something better, please contact us.
------------------------------------------------
[00000115][ロラン,char_507]
Gikaidan is so cool!
Well, I'm still not so sure...
------------------------------------------------
[00000116][ロラン,char_507]
When I grow up, I'll become a Jikaidan too,
Protect this village!
------------------------------------------------
[00000117][ロラン,char_507]
Maia-sensei's attitude is bad, isn't it?
It's not even fun to play...
This doesn't mean school is closed...
------------------------------------------------
[00000118][ロラン,char_507]
I'm glad Maia-sensei is recovering well...
I completely forgot about my homework,
I'm scared for the next time we meet...
------------------------------------------------
[00000119][カール,char_508]
Velvet-san is a nice person.
------------------------------------------------
[00000120][カール,char_508]
There are various things going on.
------------------------------------------------
[00000121][カール,char_508]
Karl doesn't understand.
------------------------------------------------
[00000122][カール,char_508]
Hey, Freed?
Pirates are scary, right? He's a bad guy, right?
Why are you friends with someone like that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000123][カール,char_508]
I see……
There are many different types of pirates.
------------------------------------------------
[00000124][カール,char_508]
If Freed is like that,
Shall I talk to you next time?
------------------------------------------------
[00000125][カール,char_508]
Hmm, that's right.
------------------------------------------------
[00000126][カール,char_508]
...So, what is "Jijo"?
------------------------------------------------
[00000127][カール,char_508]
ah! They treat children and cheat!
that's enough!
------------------------------------------------
[00000128][カール,char_508]
...Well then, Freed can't answer either, can he?
I'm kind of worried...
------------------------------------------------
[00000129][カール,char_508]
Velvet, why is her belly button sticking out?
If you did something like that, you'd definitely want to go, right?
Or maybe he's a picky shop?
------------------------------------------------
[00000130][カール,char_508]
Guss... Mr. Maia...
Is it okay...?
I hope you get well soon...
------------------------------------------------
[00000131][カール,char_508]
Wow! Wow!
I'm glad that Maia-sensei is feeling better!
I'll see you again at school every day!
------------------------------------------------
[00000132][メリー,char_509]
Hey, there's a fountain in the plaza, right?
When it's hot, I play in the water over there.
------------------------------------------------
[00000133][メリー,char_509]
There is something different and interesting about it than the sea.
It's refreshing and feels so good!
------------------------------------------------
[00000134][メリー,char_509]
When I curl my hair, I just cry all the time.
I'm worried about Maia-sensei...
------------------------------------------------
[00000135][メリー,char_509]
Karl, among us,
Because I really like Maia-sensei...
------------------------------------------------
[00000136][メリー,char_509]
I'm glad that Maia-sensei is doing well!
My curls, which had fallen down, became healthy again,
Let's all have fun together again!
------------------------------------------------
[00000137][ハンス,char_510]
I got another treasure...
If you look at it differently, every time I go on an adventure,
It means that the treasures on the island are decreasing.
------------------------------------------------
[00000138][ハンス,char_510]
You guys are so excited
I'll take all the treasures on the island, okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000139][ボリス,char_511]
As I watched you bravely fight at sea,
My blood is boiling!
The pain in my lower back was completely blown away!
------------------------------------------------
[00000140][ボリス,char_511]
Velvet-chan, are you okay with wearing such light clothes?
If you leave your belly button exposed,
I'm going to catch a cold.
------------------------------------------------
[00000141][デボラ,char_512]
Inside the farm, there is a gentle slope.
Be careful not to fall while running around.
------------------------------------------------
[00000142][デボラ,char_512]
Looks like the monster is gone.
I'm sure my prayers to the guardian deity were answered.
I must continue to pray.
------------------------------------------------
[00000143][ハイラム,char_513]
Thank you, I'll be careful.
------------------------------------------------
[00000144][ハイラム,char_513]
It's okay, I can swim.
------------------------------------------------
[00000145][ハイラム,char_513]
It's not much different than on land.
------------------------------------------------
[00000146][ハイラム,char_513]
Were you supposed to fight at sea?
After all, it's probably more dangerous than on land.
Please be very careful...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000147][ハイラム,char_513]
Well, Freed is solid.
I think he's okay though.
------------------------------------------------
[00000148][ハイラム,char_513]
But make sure you don't get hurt.
------------------------------------------------
[00000149][ハイラム,char_513]
I know that but...
I have to be careful not to fall in the first place.
------------------------------------------------
[00000150][ハイラム,char_513]
That won't happen.
After all, the footing is probably unstable...
You really have to be careful, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000151][ハイラム,char_513]
Fu, Freed! Please give me some reply!
Uncle, you're getting more and more worried!
------------------------------------------------
[00000152][ハイラム,char_513]
This island is peaceful.
But in the past...
There may have been a battle on this island too...
------------------------------------------------
[00000153][ハイラム,char_513]
Hmm, the woman named Velvet...
About the secrets of this island that we don't even know about.
Maybe she knows something...
------------------------------------------------
[00000154][リアン,char_514]
Everyone in the village loves this village.
Sometimes we have troubles, but in the end we work together
The good thing is that you can get through it.
------------------------------------------------

I'm glad you saved the village, but
Actually, I'm really worried about everyone.
Freed, please take care of Shannon and Panis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000156][ダリオ,char_515]
When the village children grow up,
A great vigilante group like us
That's what I want it to be.
------------------------------------------------
[00000157][ダリオ,char_515]
Until now, we have been desperately trying to become pirates.
I chased him away.
------------------------------------------------
[00000158][ダリオ,char_515]
So the pirates became friends,
I hope you can help us...
I have mixed feelings...
------------------------------------------------
[00000159][ミルコ,char_516]
If I were to keep watch like this,
The movements of the pirates are obvious!
------------------------------------------------
[00000160][ミルコ,char_516]
We won't let pirate ships interfere with our trade!
Lana-san, please keep an eye on my activities!
------------------------------------------------
[00000161][ミルコ,char_516]
Bacchus is truly an unforgiving person...
However, the reason for giving up so much is that
On the other hand, maybe we should learn from him...
------------------------------------------------
[00000162][ロドリゴ,char_517]
After completing the village patrol,
Having a drink at Alise's restaurant is
I'm looking forward to it more than anything.
------------------------------------------------
[00000163][ロドリゴ,char_517]
I was surprised!
Velvet guy is teaching me how to fight properly!
------------------------------------------------
[00000164][ロドリゴ,char_517]
Zynga and the others seem to be listening intently,
It also appears that their naval combat skills have improved.
That's a big deal! Let's apologize later.
------------------------------------------------
[00000165][ダニエル,char_518]
During this time, Peter
He made a mistake so I scolded him, but
Maybe he said it a little too harshly...
------------------------------------------------
[00000166][ダニエル,char_518]
Was Peter feeling depressed?
------------------------------------------------
[00000167][ダニエル,char_518]
A new person named Velvet came to the village.
He seems quite beautiful, doesn't he?
Are you willing to become my son's wife?
------------------------------------------------
[00000168][ダニエル,char_518]
……picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000169][ブレンダ,char_519]
After all, Peter is a good guy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000170][ブレンダ,char_519]
After all, we've been friends since childhood!
------------------------------------------------
[00000171][ブレンダ,char_519]
I also have something to do at the ranch.
------------------------------------------------
[00000172][ブレンダ,char_519]
Freed, Panis.
always with my peter
Thank you for being such a good friend.
------------------------------------------------
[00000173][ブレンダ,char_519]
Fufufu, that kid too.
I hope Freed and the others come to visit us.
Looks like I'm looking forward to it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000174][ブレンダ,char_519]
Yeah, we used to play together all the time.
Thank you for your continued support.
------------------------------------------------
[00000175][ブレンダ,char_519]
Oh, then Peter is next?
That's a little sad.
------------------------------------------------
[00000176][ブレンダ,char_519]
what happened?...Did you get into a fight with Peter?
------------------------------------------------
[00000177][ブレンダ,char_519]
During this time, Gon! There was a loud sound,
Just when I was wondering what it was...
Mr. Kilmaria had crashed into a large tree.
------------------------------------------------
[00000178][ブレンダ,char_519]
The habit of walking while thinking,
I think it's better to fix it because it's dangerous.
------------------------------------------------
[00000179][ブレンダ,char_519]
I hear there are new friends in the village?
This time she doesn't seem like a pretty woman.
Please tell him to come visit the ranch too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000180][ピーター,char_520]
I just fell asleep the other day,
Meanwhile, one of the sheep went somewhere.
------------------------------------------------
[00000181][ピーター,char_520]
I'm glad you're back, but
My father scolded me severely...
------------------------------------------------
[00000182][ピーター,char_520]
The person who came to the village this time is a female pirate?
Isn't she a very manly woman...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000183][ピーター,char_520]
picture? Is she really beautiful?
That's right……
------------------------------------------------
[00000184][ラナ,char_528]
Is there a way to prevent seasickness?
------------------------------------------------
[00000185][ラナ,char_528]
How do you escape from the enemy by boat?
------------------------------------------------
[00000186][ラナ,char_528]
No, nothing in particular.
------------------------------------------------
[00000187][ラナ,char_528]
Looks like you're having a hard time fighting on the ship.
Unfortunately, I can't teach you anything about naval battles.
If it's something else, I might be able to tell you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000188][ラナ,char_528]
copper? Is there anything you want to ask?
------------------------------------------------
[00000189][ラナ,char_528]
Freed, do you get seasick?
Wow, that's surprising...
Well, I'll tell you something good.
------------------------------------------------
[00000190][ラナ,char_528]
If you put dried ubomessi seeds on your belly button,
I don't get seasick!
...I don't get drunk, so I've never tried it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000191][ラナ,char_528]
Geez...I think I've said it before,
Anyway, I'll make use of my boat legs and escape.
My ship is fast anyway.
------------------------------------------------
[00000192][ラナ,char_528]
...But you guys can't run away, so
Isn't there no other choice but to fight on a ship?
Would it be helpful if you asked me how to escape?
------------------------------------------------
[00000193][ラナ,char_528]
I see...I don't have anything to ask you...
A little disappointing...
------------------------------------------------
[00000194][ラナ,char_528]
...Don't worry so much.
Well, if you come up with something, feel free to call me anytime.
------------------------------------------------
[00000195][ラナ,char_528]
If nothing happens during the voyage,
I was so bored that I wondered if a storm would come.
I can't help but think about it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000196][ラナ,char_528]
But that's when it's dangerous!
Being careless is the enemy!
------------------------------------------------
[00000197][ラナ,char_528]
Looks like it was another tough battle.
Was the ship okay?
------------------------------------------------
