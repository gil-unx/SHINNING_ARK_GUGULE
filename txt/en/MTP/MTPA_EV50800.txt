[00000000][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Adam!
It's back to normal!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
That expression is not accurate.
I didn't go back to normal,
I changed myself... I was reborn.
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I don't care about the details!
Adam has returned to the group.
That's enough!
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Adam...thank you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][ケルビム,char_529]
...Eliminating enemy races!
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Everyone, it's still too early to rejoice.
The cherubim is still up and running!
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][フリード,char_001 Fried]
With Adam, we have 100 people!
Let's get revenge!
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][ケルビム,char_529]
...exclusion...exclusion...hi...
…………………
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
...It's great to see it stopped.
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yay, you won!
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
... Cherubim.
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Up until now, I have been the same as you.
It was a weapon that simply followed a program.
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
But now it's different.
I have been reborn.
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Goodbye, my fellow countrymen...
I used to be...
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Actually, I don't want to do this.
Fighting for no reason...
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
There's a reason.
You are here to protect the child.
I want to kill that child.
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
If you don't like it, just move away.
Kill Panis and everything will be over.
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's...wrong!
That's absolutely ridiculous!
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
...Maybe so.
But, whether I'm wrong or not,
I don't have a choice.
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
If you're just trying to get in the way...
Let's go?
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Damn it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][フリード,char_001 Fried]
The world where giants appeared has no choice but to perish.
How can you say that!
Maybe destruction can be prevented!
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
There's no way I can do it!
That's about it, you guys too.
If you were researching things in another world, you would understand, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
That's wrong!
The other world has not been destroyed yet!
I'm still asking for help!
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
……What was that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Things have changed!
Please don't cling to old ideas.
Hear us!
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
...But that doesn't change anything!
Even if it hasn't perished yet, sever the connection!
Before disaster comes to this world!
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I'm saying that's wrong!
Why don't you understand?
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Want to sever ties with another world?
That's right. If you cut it off, it's definitely a giant.
It might not come out here.
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
If you know, why bother?
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
But okay? Are you satisfied with that?
Kill a girl, save the world,
Is there a future in such a world?
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
...I told you, right?
Whether you want it or not!
I don't have a choice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Throw away one and take ten thousand. Very true in a sense.
...It must have been a difficult choice.
Your courageous decision deserves praise.
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
However, you are limiting your choices to me.
It just looks like that, right? Cutting off disasters from the source
Don't you think that would be more interesting?
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Disaster... from the beginning?
……What do you mean?
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Save the world of Panis!
If we do that, no one will need to be afraid of giants anymore!
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Saving another world...?
But that kind of thing...
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
...I think I can do it.
Freed is a man.
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
How do you save it?
That's just a fantasy! I can't do it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I know it's difficult.
But I don't want to give up without even trying!
I would hate to abandon Panis without doing anything!
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
For that reason...!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Sister, sometimes people
It works based on more than logic, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I can't do it alone! Panis alone is not enough!
Still, if we all work together, I'm sure...!
So, Viola-san, please lend me your strength!
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Save another world...
Certainly, if you can do that, Endias too...
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Mr. Viola!
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
...Don't get me wrong.
I'm not convinced by what you said.
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
But... it made me feel it.
Another possibility that I couldn't even imagine.
The possibility that you believe so hard...
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Mr. Viola...
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Let me think about it for a moment.
I want to be alone and think about it.
What you guys said...
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
See you again, Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I don't know what you're thinking, but
If you want to try it, I'll do my best!
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It's coming!
Panis, sing!
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][パニス,char_002 Panis]
……Yeah!
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
...It's a waste.
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][パニス,char_002 Panis]
……No good!
My song... is being drowned out!
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Isn't it superior!
If you can fight without the support of songs, then do it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's right, what you don't have can't be helped!
Everyone, let's brace ourselves and fight!
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Mr. Viola...
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
I lost... yeah.
I lost.
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][パニス,char_002 Panis]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
...It made me feel that way.
Your strong feelings...
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
If this is the case, or...
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Viola-san?
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Freed, Panis.
……see you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oops.
There are monsters in the ruins after all.
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][マイア,char_503]
I'm in trouble...
With this, neither I nor the children can help.
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Are you okay.
We are here for times like this!
Panis, let's go!
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah.
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Okay, I defeated them all!
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][ロラン,char_507]
Wow!
Freed is strong after all!
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][メリー,char_509]
Thank you Panis too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][パニス,char_002 Panis]
The ruins are now safe.
Everyone, please!
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][フリード,char_001 Fried]
We arrived.
What should I do here?
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Clean up the scattered rubble
I want you to clean the altar.
Can I ask you a favor?
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][ジム,char_502]
But there are monsters roaming around,
Can we help you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Then it's okay!
I'll clean it up right away!
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Huh.
Were you able to get rid of the monster somehow?
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][ジム,char_502]
As long as there aren't any monsters, it's all here!
Leave the rest to us!
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yes, nice to meet you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][ハンス,char_510]
Should I clean up the rubble here?
This is an easy win!
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][ピーター,char_520]
But what about that monster?
------------------------------------------------
[00000083][フリード,char_001 Fried]
In that case, we'll take care of it right away!
Wait a minute!
------------------------------------------------
[00000084][アリーゼ,char_504]
Nice to meet you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000085][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It seems like there are no more monsters.
Well then, everyone, please.
------------------------------------------------
[00000086][ハンス,char_510]
Oh, I'm tired of waiting!
Look at this rubble.
I'll clean it up in an instant!
------------------------------------------------
[00000087][アリーゼ,char_504]
Dad!
Don't get too excited and hurt your back, okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000088][リアン,char_514]
Even though it's full of ice,
It's not cold at all...
This item has a great effect.
------------------------------------------------
[00000089][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Auntie, don't be impressed by this strange thing.
Panis, why don't we just clean up the rubble here?
------------------------------------------------
[00000090][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah.
But there are a lot of monsters and it's dangerous.
------------------------------------------------
[00000091][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree.
First, let's take care of the monsters.
------------------------------------------------
[00000092][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Okay, now the monsters are gone.
------------------------------------------------
[00000093][ハイラム,char_513]
Freed... you've become stronger.
I'm happy that you've grown so well.
------------------------------------------------
[00000094][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Even if you're not impressed at a time like this...
------------------------------------------------
[00000095][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hehehe.
Now, let's all clean up the rubble!
------------------------------------------------
[00000096][ケルビム,char_529]
Reacts to close combat range.
1 enemy species, 1 friendly aircraft. Many others.
------------------------------------------------
[00000097][ケルビム,char_529]
No response from friendly aircraft to tactical link request.
Determined to have lost functionality or to be under enemy control.
Dispose of it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000098][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Are you still going to fight, Cherubim...
Although the situation has already changed,
Still following the old program...
------------------------------------------------
[00000099][ケルビム,char_529]
Shift to battle mode.
Target, supplement.
------------------------------------------------
[00000100][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Iron boy! I'll leave the sentimentality behind!
If we don't defeat him, the Ark will be destroyed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000101][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Adam……!
------------------------------------------------
[00000102][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Yeah……
I already know……!
------------------------------------------------
[00000103][ケルビム,char_529]
Attack system, activated.
Eliminate enemy races.
I repeat, eliminate the enemy race.
------------------------------------------------
[00000104][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
It is unavoidable...!
Now I will shut you up! Cherubim!
------------------------------------------------
[00000105][ケルビム,char_529]
Emergency...warning...
Failed to eliminate the enemy race...
------------------------------------------------
[00000106][ケルビム,char_529]
All systems...Emergency stop...
------------------------------------------------
[00000107][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000108][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I wondered what would happen for a while, but...
Looks like you managed to win.
------------------------------------------------
[00000109][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Wow! I was surprised.
What's that sound?
------------------------------------------------
[00000110][ケルビム,char_529]
Backup system is normal...
Power supply, switching...
------------------------------------------------
[00000111][ケルビム,char_529]
System, all reset.
This will start the reboot.
------------------------------------------------
[00000112][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Cherubim's internal power source is operational!
Rebooting!
------------------------------------------------
[00000113][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What did you say!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000114][ケルビム,char_529]
System check completed.
We have confirmed a problem with some functions.
Enter self-healing mode.
------------------------------------------------
[00000115][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Again!?
Now, get over it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000116][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
The warp system is starting to work!
If this continues, the next one will come!
------------------------------------------------
[00000117][フリード,char_001 Fried]
One after another, endless!
If it stays like this...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000118][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed, everyone, thank you again.
Lend me your strength...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000119][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Leave it to me, Panis!
We'll always be by your side!
------------------------------------------------
[00000120][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
It brings everyone's hearts together.
You guys...uh...
Let's share our thoughts!
------------------------------------------------
[00000121][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Did you show up to warn us?
If this continues, this world will perish...
------------------------------------------------
[00000122][パニス,char_002 Panis]
If so...I think that's certainly the case.
We pollute this world with our own hands,
It has been destroyed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000123][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I think I've done something really stupid.
You must have been in pain too.
sorry……
------------------------------------------------
[00000124][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Even people in this world are suffering all the time!
I am also reflecting! So please forgive me now!
------------------------------------------------
[00000125][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Panis' words are for everyone in this world,
These words literally come from the heart!
Please listen to me!
------------------------------------------------
[00000126][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
You think for everyone in this world,
This is how you showed up, right? thank you.
But I think it's enough. Cut it out already……!
------------------------------------------------
[00000127][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Not just me, but people all over the world,
Everyone is reflecting on what has happened so far.
Please listen...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000128][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
So, did it arrive...?
Our thoughts...
------------------------------------------------
[00000129][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I hope so...
No, wait a minute! Something's wrong!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000130][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
What, what is this?
Kyaaaaaaaaaaaa!
------------------------------------------------
[00000131][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Hey, here...?
Is it inside the giant...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000132][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Looks like you've been invited.
Hey, does that mean you opened up to me?
------------------------------------------------
[00000133][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
But the Giants don't seem to be convinced yet.
Just reflect on what has happened so far,
Does that mean I can't trust you...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000134][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Anyway, let's keep appealing!
Until everyone's feelings are understood!
------------------------------------------------
[00000135][パニス,char_002 Panis]
You're testing us, aren't you?
The hearts of people in this world...
------------------------------------------------
[00000136][パニス,char_002 Panis]
If so, please feel it.
Our sincere remorse and heartfelt determination.
------------------------------------------------
[00000137][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Things that wake you up
I will never do it again.
I won't repeat the same mistake.
------------------------------------------------
[00000138][パニス,char_002 Panis]
that's why……
Don't make everyone suffer anymore!
------------------------------------------------
[00000139][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
You, too, are a warning to people who have gone astray.
It should have fulfilled its role as a warning.
I think it will have the opposite effect if it goes any further than this, but what do you think?
------------------------------------------------
[00000140][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Making people suffer excessively
I think it goes against Justice.
Even if the motive is correct...
------------------------------------------------
[00000141][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yes, especially if it's the right one!
------------------------------------------------
[00000142][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Even a machine like me can understand the importance of life.
From people in this world
Don't take away that precious thing!
------------------------------------------------
[00000143][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
your true purpose is
It shouldn't be about destroying the people of this world.
Don't extinguish the fire of life from the world!
------------------------------------------------
[00000144][パニス,char_002 Panis]
please!
Give us a chance to start over! Please give me a future!
------------------------------------------------
[00000145][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Did you agree...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000146][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Phew...it looks like we've managed to get the story across.
I'm already exhausted...
------------------------------------------------
[00000147][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
………!?
wait a minute?
No way, that was...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000148][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis...
------------------------------------------------
[00000149][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed...
Shall we start...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000150][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah……!
------------------------------------------------
[00000151][パニス,char_002 Panis]
older sister……
Thank you for making me your sister.
I was so happy that you loved me like your real family...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000152][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Panis...
Me and Freed, my father and my mother,
We'll always be your family...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000153][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis!
Light comes from the wings...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000154][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I'm still okay...
do not worry……
------------------------------------------------
[00000155][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Jinga, sorry for the inconvenience.
But please forgive me...
Thank you for letting me join you again!
------------------------------------------------
[00000156][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
What do you say? It was me who was wrong.
You have been and will always be
You'll always be our friend!
------------------------------------------------
[00000157][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Adam, thank you for always protecting me.
Adam's shoulders when he carried me on his shoulders...
It was very warm...
------------------------------------------------
[00000158][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I don't have a body temperature like Mr. Panis.
However, if you feel that way...
I am very happy……
------------------------------------------------
[00000159][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Kill Maria...
I think I owe you an apology.
Because I am what you first thought...
------------------------------------------------
[00000160][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
What are you saying!
You are not the devil!
After all, this is how we save the world!
------------------------------------------------
[00000161][パニス,char_002 Panis]
velvet……
I think the "power" you have is truly amazing.
That power that pulls everyone together...
------------------------------------------------
[00000162][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What's even more amazing is your "power."
Someday, I'll make it mine.
...Until then, I won't die!
------------------------------------------------
[00000163][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Levin. You became my friend,
It was really reassuring for me and Freed.
I'll never forget what you taught me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000164][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
That's right, don't forget.
If you trust, rely on, and cooperate with others, you can accomplish most things.
I'll lend you my strength as much as I can!
------------------------------------------------
[00000165][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Thanks to you, my feelings were conveyed to the giant.
Thanks to you, I've come this far.
Viola, you are our benefactor.
------------------------------------------------
[00000166][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
I feel both indebted and guilty.
Let me make amends for that, Panis!
That's why... that's why I'm still alive until then...!

We've hurt each other enough.
If we make the world suffer, we will only suffer ourselves.
Instead, let's all laugh and live together!

The sky and the world are connected!
Let's all hold hands and walk together!
We're right next to you too!

Freed...
Thank you for finding me.
Thank you for being with me.

you always give me strength
you always help me.
Because of you...I can be myself.
