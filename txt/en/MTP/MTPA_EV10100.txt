@lt1@ll24On this island, far from the continent, where ships rarely pass,
Since when did people start living here?
I don't know much.
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][]
@lt1@ll24But when I was a baby,
By the time I arrived on this island,
Many people live on this island...
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][]
@lt1@ll24Build a village, grow crops, catch fish,
We all lived together and supported each other.
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][]
@lt1@ll24Why did I wash up on the island?
Of course I don't remember that...
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][]
@lt1@ll24Anyway, from that day on, I
Uncle, aunt, sister Shannon,
And he lives with everyone in the village.
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][]
@lt1@ll24Blue sky and varied land,
And surrounded by the rich sea,
On this small and relaxing island...
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][フリード,char_001 Fried]
For today,
There was no suspicious movement in the sea.
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Well, even pirates, day in and day out.
They won't come to attack the island.
Let's go back to the village soon.
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][フリード,char_001 Fried]
……yeah? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is that some driftwood over there?
No...it's kind of weird to say that.
...No way!
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][フリード,char_001 Fried]
on second thoughts! It's a person! People are falling!
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][フリード,char_001 Fried]
……good.
There are no injuries and his breathing is calm.
It looks like he's just passed out.
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But who is this child?
There are wings on his back, but maybe he's a birdman?
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But there are no feathers other than feathers,
It doesn't even have a beak...
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][フリード,char_001 Fried]
The feathers are also somehow different...
There's only one side and it feels small...
Also, the color is black...
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][？？？,char_601]
cormorant……
Hmm...
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Are you awake!? Hey, you!
Are you okay!
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][？？？,char_601]
Hmm...
………………
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][フリード,char_001 Fried]
no good……
She fainted again.
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][？？？,char_601]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][フリード,char_001 Fried]
The more I look at her, the more mysterious she is.
It's not just the feathers on the back, it's the atmosphere.
I feel a strange feeling all over my body...
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I wonder what……
For some reason, I can't take my eyes off...
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Ha! This is no time to be admired!
I have to take him back to the village quickly!
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Please hold on a little longer.
I'll take care of it right away!
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
this is……?
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Freed? What's wrong with that child?
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I was lying on the beach.
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
On the beach? That's strange.
There were no storms recently,
I've never heard of a ship being wrecked.
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah. The fact that he was lying there...
I think it has been washed away.
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's right. It was the same with Freed when he was a baby.
But where did it come from?
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][マイア,char_503]
He has wings on his back, but he's not a birdman.
It kind of looks like an angel from a legend.
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][ジム,char_502]
ah! Legend of an angel with wings on his back.
It is said that he saved the island from being attacked by something.
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][ジム,char_502]
that? I feel like they were both pure white.
This child's is a little different...
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I also remember hearing stories about angels.
Maia-sensei taught me this. at school.
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][マイア,char_503]
That's right. Me too, from the elderly people in the village.
I heard that...
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][ハンス,char_510]
By the way, there are relics related to angel legends on the island.
There are so many left behind.
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][ハンス,char_510]
In that sense, this island
I don't know if this is a land that is connected to angels.
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][ジム,char_502]
Is it so?
Then, could this child really be...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][マイア,char_503]
I wonder if that's true?
Jim, don't you think this is going too far?
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
But this figure...
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][ガルゼー,char_501]
What's up, everyone?
What are you making a fuss about gathering in a place like this?
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Village chief. In fact, Freed
He rescued a child with wings on his back on the beach.
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][ガルゼー,char_501]
A child with wings?
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah. I don't know where it came from though.
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][ガルゼー,char_501]
Is he a child of the bird race?
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That doesn't seem to be the case.
It's this kid...
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][ジム,char_502]
That's why you're an angel! Angel!
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][ガルゼー,char_501]
angel? I see, he certainly has a strange appearance.
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][アリーゼ,char_504]
I wonder if it's an angel after all?
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][ガルゼー,char_501]
I do not know. However, if you ask him about it after he wakes up,
Isn't it a good thing to do?
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's right.
Freed, anyway, let's bring this child home.
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, I'm going to go pick some medicinal herbs.
I think it's probably necessary.
Zynga, can I ask for this girl with Shannon?
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I don't mind, but are you okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
that's right. There recently,
Are you saying you often see monsters?
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Are you okay. I can handle it by myself.
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Well then, Shannon, Zynga, take that girl!
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Okay, leave it to me.
Freed, please be careful too.
If you get injured, you'll be in trouble.
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I know.
Don't treat me like a child forever.
Well then, let's go!
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][フリード,char_001 Fried]
……copper? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Yes, my complexion has improved considerably,
His breathing seems to be stable.
The herbs are starting to work.
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][？？？,char_601]
Soooo...suu...
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
If this is the case, let it rest for a while longer.
I think I'll wake up. Looks like you don't have to worry.
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I see, that's good.
Thanks to Shannon and Zynga for watching.
……that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
what happened?
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Jinga isn't here, has he gone home?
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Someone from the vigilante group came calling just now.
Did you come out in a hurry?
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is that so? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Freed! Shannon! Come on!
A swarm of monsters is moving to the village border!
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Also? I guess it's about time for the herd to move on.
Does it look like it's going to go into the village?
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It won't come inside, but
The surrounding fields and fishing grounds are likely to be destroyed.
I need to get rid of it before that happens.
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Understood! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Well, you have to hurry!
Father! Mother!
Please watch this child for a while!
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][リアン,char_514]
I got it. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][ハイラム,char_513]
Freed, Shannon. Be careful.
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Uncle, aunt, please!
Well then, Zynga! Shannon! lets go!
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][？？？,char_601]
a!
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][？？？,char_601]
Welcome back!
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Wow! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][？？？,char_601]
Ehehe~.
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
that? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah! I can wake up and run!
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, I see. It's called Panis.
I'm Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000083][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed! Understood!
Freed helped Panis, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000084][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I wonder if that will happen.
Panis, do you remember when you came to the village?
------------------------------------------------
[00000085][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hmm, I don't remember very well.
But Freed was carrying me on his back,
I kind of understood.
------------------------------------------------
[00000086][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed's back is warm and big.
It feels good! Ehehe!
------------------------------------------------
[00000087][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Wait, Panis?
Don't hug me so much...
------------------------------------------------
[00000088][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
nothing!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000089][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Eh? why?
You gave me a piggyback ride just now.
------------------------------------------------
[00000090][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's to bring you here.
And now everyone is watching...
------------------------------------------------
[00000091][ジム,char_502]
What is it? What are you making a fuss about?
------------------------------------------------
[00000092][ハンス,char_510]
oh? Have you woken up?
------------------------------------------------
[00000093][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Tenshi? It's not Tenshi, is it? It's Panis?
------------------------------------------------
[00000094][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hey, look. Everyone has gathered together, hasn't it?
It's embarrassing so leave me...
------------------------------------------------
[00000095][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Why? Panis, this is the good thing!
------------------------------------------------
[00000096][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Yes, Panis! Get away!
Freed is in trouble!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000097][パニス,char_002 Panis]
no! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000098][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
If it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work!
------------------------------------------------
[00000099][パニス,char_002 Panis]
How?
------------------------------------------------
[00000100][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's...
Ah, as an older sister, I'm sorry for the shameful acts of her family.
I can't afford to overlook it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000101][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's not like I'm hugging you, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000102][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Is Shannon Freed's older sister?
------------------------------------------------
[00000103][フリード,char_001 Fried]
that's right. Yeah, how's Panis' family doing?
------------------------------------------------
[00000104][パニス,char_002 Panis]
family?
------------------------------------------------
[00000105][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Yes, family! Family!
Panis, where are your father and mother?
------------------------------------------------
[00000106][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Dad?　Mom?
Erm...umm...
------------------------------------------------
[00000107][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Do not you understand?
------------------------------------------------
[00000108][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah. Before I knew it, Freed was carrying me on his back,
The next thing I knew, I was asleep in bed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000109][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
So you don't know where it came from?
------------------------------------------------
[00000110][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah, I don't know.
------------------------------------------------
[00000111][ガルゼー,char_501]
Have you lost your memory?
His behavior is young compared to his appearance,
Maybe that's why.
------------------------------------------------
[00000112][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Village chief, have you come?
------------------------------------------------
[00000113][ガルゼー,char_501]
Hmm. It's noisy, so keep an eye on it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000114][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Soncho! Hello!
------------------------------------------------
[00000115][ガルゼー,char_501]
Hmm...Hello.
------------------------------------------------
[00000116][パニス,char_002 Panis]
It's Panis! nice to meet you!
Soncho, you have a lot of beard!
Can I touch it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000117][ガルゼー,char_501]
nothing? Do you want to touch it? Well, just a little bit, okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000118][パニス,char_002 Panis]
thank you! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000119][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Aaah. What about the village chief?
It's not completely dere dere.
------------------------------------------------
[00000120][マイア,char_503]
The village chief is extremely lenient with children...
------------------------------------------------
[00000121][ガルゼー,char_501]
...Did you say something?
------------------------------------------------
[00000122][マイア,char_503]
Yeah? nothing?
------------------------------------------------
[00000123][ガルゼー,char_501]
……Really?Anyway, if you have no memory and no place to go,
Let's take care of this child in the village.
------------------------------------------------
[00000124][ガルゼー,char_501]
As long as it doesn't cause any harm to the village,
Accept them as friends without rejecting them.
That's the way this village works.
------------------------------------------------
[00000125][ジム,char_502]
that's right! He might be a legendary angel!
------------------------------------------------
[00000126][マイア,char_503]
Yeah. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000127][ガルゼー,char_501]
Hmm, it seems like everyone has no objections.
So, that's the decision.
For the time being, I will ask Freed to take care of me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000128][ガルゼー,char_501]
For now, Panis-chan
Please show me around the village.
Let's get used to it as soon as possible.
------------------------------------------------
[00000129][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis...chan?
------------------------------------------------
[00000130][ガルゼー,char_501]
What's wrong?
------------------------------------------------
[00000131][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Uh, no, it's nothing.
Okay, I'll go back a little bit.
Let's go, Pani...
------------------------------------------------
[00000132][パニス,char_002 Panis]
What is that!? That!
------------------------------------------------
[00000133][フリード,char_001 Fried]
a!  It is dangerous!
------------------------------------------------
[00000134][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yay!
------------------------------------------------
[00000135][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hehehehe, I fell down...
------------------------------------------------
[00000136][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It can't be helped, now.
Hey, Panis. Let's hold hands.
------------------------------------------------
[00000137][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Can you help me?
------------------------------------------------
[00000138][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What?! Freed!
You were hugged earlier
You were embarrassed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000139][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Well, if we don't do this, this child will be in danger...
------------------------------------------------
[00000140][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Uh...
------------------------------------------------
[00000141][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Well then, let's go back a little bit.
Panis, let's go.
------------------------------------------------
[00000142][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000143][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Wait, Panis?
How long are you planning on holding Freed's hand?
------------------------------------------------
[00000144][パニス,char_002 Panis]
picture? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000145][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
No, it's not okay, but...
But I can't overlook my younger brother's shameful act...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000146][フリード,char_001 Fried]
There's nothing shameful about this!
------------------------------------------------
[00000147][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
We don't have to hold hands forever!
------------------------------------------------
[00000148][パニス,char_002 Panis]
But isn't it fun to hold hands?
Freed's hands are warm and big.
------------------------------------------------
[00000149][パニス,char_002 Panis]
a!Let's hold hands with Panis too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000150][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Oh, sister!?
about me!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000151][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah.
After all, she's Freed's older sister, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000152][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
that's right? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000153][パニス,char_002 Panis]
If so, I would like to hold hands with your sister!
I'm sure he has warm hands like Freed's!
------------------------------------------------
[00000154][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
picture? Well, that's not it!
You know, Panis. What I want to say is...
------------------------------------------------
[00000155][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Hey, you guys. Hurry up and get ready!
------------------------------------------------
[00000156][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Zynga? what happened?
------------------------------------------------
[00000157][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It seems that another monster has appeared.
I need to get rid of it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000158][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Okay, let's go.
Freed, okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000159][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Ah, I see.
But what should I do about Panis...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000160][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's right...
Panis, is it okay to be alone?
------------------------------------------------
[00000161][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis, it's okay.
------------------------------------------------
[00000162][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
yes. Wait until we get back?
------------------------------------------------
[00000163][パニス,char_002 Panis]
O.K. I understand.
I'll wait until Freed and my sister come back.
------------------------------------------------
[00000164][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Yeah, good boy!
Well, I'll be back soon!
------------------------------------------------
[00000165][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yes! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000166][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Yes, let's go!
Well then, Freed, Zinga, let's go!
------------------------------------------------
[00000167][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Eh, ah, yeah.
------------------------------------------------
[00000168][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Oh, that's right. Shall we go.
------------------------------------------------
[00000169][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed! older sister! welcome home!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000170][ガルゼー,char_501]
All three of us returned home so soon, sorry, but there was a pirate attack.
It seems that Bacchus' ship is heading this way.
Head to the beach immediately.
------------------------------------------------
[00000171][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Bacchus again!? He's a tough guy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000172][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Absolutely.
I want you to think about this inconvenience as well.
------------------------------------------------
[00000173][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It can't be helped, but pirates are pirates.
I can't just leave it alone.
------------------------------------------------
[00000174][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hey, Soncho?
What is a pirate?
------------------------------------------------
[00000175][ガルゼー,char_501]
Hmm, you can call me a pirate.
Mysterious powers and treasures are rumored to exist on this island.
These guys come by boat, aiming for the relics in the ruins.
------------------------------------------------
[00000176][ガルゼー,char_501]
Among those people,
There are some people who cause harm to the village.
I'll have Freed and the others drive them away.
------------------------------------------------
[00000177][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Is that so? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000178][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, not that much...
Ah, that's right, village chief. Panis for a while
Can I have you look at it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000179][ガルゼー,char_501]
Hmm. All right.
Until Panis-chan, Freed and the others return,
Shall we play with Soncho?
------------------------------------------------
[00000180][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000181][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Well then, village chief. Please take care of Panis.
We'll be heading over in a bit!
------------------------------------------------
[00000182][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Wow, it's getting dark now.
Panis will be waiting for me, so I have to hurry home.
------------------------------------------------
[00000183][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
But it's quite early.
I think there's still some time before sunset...
------------------------------------------------
[00000184][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed! older sister! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000185][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis? Did you come to pick me up?
------------------------------------------------
[00000186][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah! Well then, there you go!
……a!
------------------------------------------------
[00000187][フリード,char_001 Fried]
what happened? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000188][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed...
that……
------------------------------------------------
[00000189][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What do you mean “that”?
...Huh!? What? that!
------------------------------------------------
[00000190][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Why are there two moons in the sky?
------------------------------------------------
[00000191][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
What on earth was that month...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000192][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What is that...?
It's my first time seeing a moon like that...
------------------------------------------------
[00000193][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Like blood...a bright red moon...
------------------------------------------------
[00000194][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Unless it's a sign that something bad is going to happen.
Good but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000195][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hey, don't say anything weird...
------------------------------------------------
[00000196][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Yay!
------------------------------------------------
[00000197][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What? The wind is amazing...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000198][マイア,char_503]
Freed-kun! Shannon!
Zinga-san and Panis-chan too!
good!
------------------------------------------------
[00000199][アリーゼ,char_504]
You guys ~that big thing~
Did you defeat it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000200][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
No, that's not true...
------------------------------------------------
[00000201][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's not us, it's Panis.
The one who chased him away was...
------------------------------------------------
[00000202][ジム,char_502]
Really?! Awesome...!
After all, this child
Isn't she an angel who protects this village?
------------------------------------------------
[00000203][ハイラム,char_513]
Indeed, that may be the case...
------------------------------------------------
[00000204][ガルゼー,char_501]
Well done anyway.
However, Panis-chan
That big monster...
------------------------------------------------
[00000205][フリード,char_001 Fried]
When I heard a Panis song, it suddenly disappeared.
that person……
------------------------------------------------
[00000206][ガルゼー,char_501]
law……
Is that so……
------------------------------------------------
[00000207][アリーゼ,char_504]
An angel defeats monsters with song?
It's kind of amazing!
It's like a fairy tale!
------------------------------------------------
[00000208][ジム,char_502]
Hello, angel! Now we too,
You can live in peace!
------------------------------------------------
[00000209][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, that's not it.
That giant will come again...
Panis said so.
------------------------------------------------
[00000210][ジム,char_502]
picture……?
------------------------------------------------
[00000211][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis says, sing to him.
It's just that ``I was sent home.''
That's why he's coming again...
------------------------------------------------
[00000212][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000213][ジム,char_502]
Oh, that’s it…!
If that happens, the village will be destroyed again!
------------------------------------------------
[00000214][マイア,char_503]
What are we going to do from now on?
What should I do...
------------------------------------------------
[00000215][ジム,char_502]
The village is already in tatters, isn't it?
If I could come again for something like that...
Isn't this time it's over?
------------------------------------------------
[00000216][ジム,char_502]
There's no point in trying to fix the village...
Tohohoho…
I thought I was able to help you...
------------------------------------------------
[00000217][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hey, wait a minute, everyone!
Sure, he might come again, but
If you give up, that's the end, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000218][ジム,char_502]
So, what should we do!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000219][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's already decided!
Fix the village, prepare properly,
Let's all stand together!
------------------------------------------------
[00000220][フリード,char_001 Fried]
This is our village, isn't it?
We must all protect it!
We can do it! I'm sure you can do it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000221][ジム,char_502]
But...
------------------------------------------------
[00000222][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
No, I think Freed is right.
------------------------------------------------
[00000223][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's right. I think so too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000224][アリーゼ,char_504]
It's our village!
------------------------------------------------
[00000225][マイア,char_503]
If we all work together,
The results may also be different.
------------------------------------------------
[00000226][ハンス,char_510]
That's right! I'll cooperate too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000227][ハイラム,char_513]
Me too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000228][リアン,char_514]
Of course, me too!
I can't just let my son and daughter do it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000229][ジム,char_502]
Eh, erm, erm, erm...
Oh, I understand! I'll do it too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000230][ガルゼー,char_501]
……HM.
Understood. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000231][ガルゼー,char_501]
So what we should do is
The first step is to rebuild the destroyed village.
------------------------------------------------
[00000232][ガルゼー,char_501]
And in response to another giant attack,
It's about building up all the necessary preparations.
------------------------------------------------
[00000233][ガルゼー,char_501]
Let's join forces and restore the peaceful village to its former state!
And let's protect the village from the giants!
------------------------------------------------
[00000234][ハイラム,char_513]
agreement!
------------------------------------------------
[00000235][ハンス,char_510]
I agree!
------------------------------------------------
[00000236][マイア,char_503]
me too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000237][ガルゼー,char_501]
Thank you, guys! Now, let's all come together,
Let's do our best for a better life on the island!
------------------------------------------------
[00000238][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (To repair the village, prepare for the giants?
I'll be busy again tomorrow! )
