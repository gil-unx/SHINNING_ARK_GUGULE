[00000000][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Peter! Today, I will also help Panis!
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][ピーター,char_520]
picture? It's helpful, but... are you okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][ダニエル,char_518]
That's okay, Peter.
Why don't you ask for some help?
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][ブレンダ,char_519]
That's right. The animals also love Panis-chan,
I'm sure you'll be happy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Well, I'm with you too, so it's okay.
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][ピーター,char_520]
……I agree.
Well then, Panis, please.
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah!
Well, then what should I do?
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][ピーター,char_520]
Can you gather the sheep for me?
When you play this flute, the sheep will come to you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Really!? Let's try it!
Phew! Phew!
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][パニス,char_002 Panis]
No sound...
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][ダニエル,char_518]
Just calm down and blow gently.
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah……
Phew... phew...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][パニス,char_002 Panis]
It’s out!
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][フリード,char_001 Fried]
that……? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][ブレンダ,char_519]
very much! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Ah, what?!
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][ピーター,char_520]
Panis is riding on the sheep!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis!
Panis, are you okay!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Wow!　Amazingly amazing!
Fluffy and fluffy!
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][ダニエル,char_518]
good……
Apparently there's no danger.
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Wow! Hashire Hashire!
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (I was surprised though...
Panis and sheep seem to be having fun, so it's okay.)
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hello ba-chan!
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][デボラ,char_512]
Hey there, Panis. You're doing well today too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][デボラ,char_512]
That's right, that's right. But a healthy child
You have to eat whatever you want, no matter what you like, right?
Does Panis-chan have any likes or dislikes?
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis, I love bread!
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][デボラ,char_512]
Is there anything you don't like?
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's okay.
Panis will eat anything.
On the contrary, I'm worried that I'll eat too much.
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][デボラ,char_512]
yes? But what about Freed?
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][フリード,char_001 Fried]
me? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Come to think of it, Freed, I left some vegetable bread the other day.
My sister was mad at me...
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][デボラ,char_512]
Oh my! That's not right!
You have to eat your vegetables too.
That's right, would you like to have some of these vegetables?
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, wait a minute!
The vegetable bread at that time was just Shannon's failure.
It's not that I don't like vegetables...
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][デボラ,char_512]
Come on, excuses aren't good, are they?
Fresh vegetables are so delicious.
Yes, you should bring this as well.
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But...wow! It's heavy!
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][デボラ,char_512]
He's a boy, so he has to be strong.
Here, do your best and bring it home.
Do you eat vegetables properly?
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Good luck, Freed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][フリード,char_001 Fried]
U-Yeah...but...it's heavy...
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (sigh...Grandma Deborah, you're so kind.
I can be nosy sometimes...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hmm...
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][フリード,char_001 Fried]
what happened? Staring at the sheep.
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis, I don't know the names of these kids...
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is that so? I thought you already knew it since you were playing with it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis, I want to know the names of these children!
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Even if you say that, I don't even know...
Hey Peter. Can you tell me?
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][ピーター,char_520]
What are the names of the sheep?
The big one on the left is Don, and the round one in the middle is Koro.
The small one on the right is Chi.
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Huh...that's right...
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][ピーター,char_520]
Every child is our proud sheep.
Don's fur is very soft,
Koro produces a lot of milk, and Chi is quick.
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I see...that's great, Peter.
I look at each sheep carefully.
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][ピーター,char_520]
Well, that's normal,
I get embarrassed when I get praised like that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hehe, nice to meet you!
Pon! Toro! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][ピーター,char_520]
No, no, it's Don, Koro, Chi.
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I see. Sorry, Chi.
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][ピーター,char_520]
That's Koro...
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Oh, what?
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][ピーター,char_520]
Hahaha, you should learn the name slowly.
As always, try to get along with these kids.
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah!Nice to meet you! Gon! Noro! C!
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][ピーター,char_520]
Don, Koro, Chee...
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][パニス,char_002 Panis]
The wind is so nice~, Freed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][フリード,char_001 Fried]
eh?
Ah, uh, yeah. I agree……
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (I couldn't help but admire Panis's hair flowing in the wind...
Panis's hair is beautiful...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Chickens, sheep.
Come here!
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (If you just reach out a little
You can touch Panis' hair...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (No, no, you can't do that.
If you suddenly do that,
Panis would be surprised too...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (...but as far as conveying my feelings is concerned)
Isn't it okay to do that? )
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Fortunately, it's just me and Panis here.
No one should be bothered. Okay…)
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Pa-panis... I-I want you to listen to me...
Oh, about me, Panis...
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I love it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, really!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah!
Panis, I love sheep!
Fluffy, fluffy, and gentle!
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Huh...sheep...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hey, hey, sheep!
Come over here and let's play with Panis!
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (I never thought I would lose to a sheep...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (...but Panis seems happy to see the sheep,
whatever)
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Ah! Peter!
Don't bully the sheep!
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][ピーター,char_520]
Huh!? Pa, Panis!? What, all of a sudden?
You're not bullying the sheep, are you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][パニス,char_002 Panis]
But the sheep
I'm squeezing her with my hands and teasing her!
If you do that, you'll be fine!
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][ピーター,char_520]
Ah...is this it? This is different.
This is milking a sheep.
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Chichi?
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][ピーター,char_520]
yes. The milk used to bake bread is
This is how they are separated from the sheep.
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Doesn't it hurt?
------------------------------------------------
[00000083][ピーター,char_520]
Of course it doesn't hurt. On the other hand, if you don't tighten it up from time to time,
The sheep are suffering. My breasts will get swollen.
------------------------------------------------
[00000084][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Oh I see……
------------------------------------------------
[00000085][ピーター,char_520]
Would you like to try panis as well?
------------------------------------------------
[00000086][パニス,char_002 Panis]
okay? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000087][ピーター,char_520]
So why don't you come and sit here?
And then there's sheep's milk...yes, there.
Hold it gently...
------------------------------------------------
[00000088][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Oh, what? Nothing comes out...
Hmm...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000089][ピーター,char_520]
ah! It'll hurt if you squeeze that hard!
------------------------------------------------
[00000090][パニス,char_002 Panis]
But I don't want to...
------------------------------------------------
[00000091][ピーター,char_520]
It doesn't hurt if you do it normally, but if it's too strong...
So, how about I take your place?
I'll show you how.
------------------------------------------------
[00000092][ピーター,char_520]
Look, like this... like this.
------------------------------------------------
[00000093][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Wow...that's amazing!
Peter, you're so good...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000094][ピーター,char_520]
No, no, well... ever since I was little,
Because I do it every day.
So, Panis. Could you try that again?
------------------------------------------------
[00000095][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah!
------------------------------------------------
[00000096][カール,char_508]
Hey, hey!
What do you think, what happened?
------------------------------------------------
[00000097][メリー,char_509]
Let's do this~!
------------------------------------------------
[00000098][バッカス,char_527]
Wow, what the heck is this!
I'm not the type of person who can be defeated at this level!
------------------------------------------------
[00000099][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, is that... Bacchus?
And even children and sheep!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000100][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is he actually fighting with a child?
No, no matter how Bacchus he is, he would never do such a stupid thing...
------------------------------------------------
[00000101][バッカス,char_527]
If this happens, it's my special secret!
Take the Super Ultra Punch!
------------------------------------------------
[00000102][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Bacchus, what are you doing here?
------------------------------------------------
[00000103][バッカス,char_527]
...Freed!?
Hey, since when did you stop being there?
------------------------------------------------
[00000104][ロラン,char_507]
Freed, don't get in the way! !
Right now I'm playing with Bacchus!
------------------------------------------------
[00000105][メリー,char_509]
That's it!
Hey, Freed, let's play together!
------------------------------------------------
[00000106][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Huh!? Hey, wait a minute.
Bacchus, what do you mean?
------------------------------------------------
[00000107][バッカス,char_527]
It's not like this.
A casual walk... When I came to scout,
The kids found me...
------------------------------------------------
[00000108][バッカス,char_527]
What's more, this sheep guy
It has my clothes in its mouth and won't let go...
------------------------------------------------
[00000109][バッカス,char_527]
Because the kids really want to play with me,
We had no choice but to play together.
------------------------------------------------
[00000110][カール,char_508]
Because Uncle Bacchus,
Whenever I come to the village, they always play with me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000111][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, that's right...I didn't know...
I mean, what are you playing with?
------------------------------------------------
[00000112][バッカス,char_527]
That one...
Or playing pirates.
------------------------------------------------
[00000113][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Isn't that what it is?
------------------------------------------------
[00000114][メリー,char_509]
Hey, Freed!
Freed is also a pirate!
------------------------------------------------
[00000115][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, I have something to do...
You should let Uncle Bacchus play with you today.
------------------------------------------------
[00000116][バッカス,char_527]
Oh, hey, Freed!
Please keep this a secret!
My dignity as a pirate...
------------------------------------------------
[00000117][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I don't think that's the case originally...
Well, I guess I don't understand how you feel.
Understood. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000118][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Instead, with the children
Please play a lot!
------------------------------------------------
[00000119][バッカス,char_527]
Oh, oh... I can't help it.
Now, your opponent is the great pirate Bacchus!
Come on, come on!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000120][ロラン,char_507]
oh! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000121][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I'll have it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000122][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis, you don't have to eat it in such a hurry.
There are so many of them that you won't run out.
------------------------------------------------
[00000123][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
No wonder you want to eat in a hurry!
No matter which one you choose, it's super delicious!
Nggkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk kkk kkkkkkkkkk 
------------------------------------------------
[00000124][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Killmaria-san, don't panic too much.
Yes, tea.
------------------------------------------------
[00000125][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Oh, thank you very much……
Halfway through The Exorcist,
I almost lost my life...
------------------------------------------------
[00000126][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Things like this are nice and relaxing.
It's too relaxing,
I feel like I'm forgetting about work.
------------------------------------------------
[00000127][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Isn't it nice once in a while?
In life, sometimes you need a break.
------------------------------------------------
[00000128][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Hahaha, for those who live their lives in their spare time,
I don't want you to say that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000129][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Ah~! It's terrible!
Freed, Zinga is bullying you!
Comfort me, poor me!
------------------------------------------------
[00000130][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Wait a minute? Mr. Velvet!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000131][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Here, there!
Stay away from Freed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000132][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Adam, I wish I could have dinner with you.
That would have been nice.
------------------------------------------------
[00000133][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
You don't need to worry about me.
I can't eat, but
Just being with you is enough.
------------------------------------------------
[00000134][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Anyway, why is it suddenly a picnic?
It's certainly a perfect day for a picnic,
I thought it was a little too abrupt.
------------------------------------------------
[00000135][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Ah, that's it.
There was supposed to be a meeting of the merchant association today,
Apparently it was canceled at the last minute.
------------------------------------------------
[00000136][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
The lunch box I was supposed to eat there,
So I had a lot left over.
------------------------------------------------
[00000137][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
So, why is there such a large amount?
We can't eat enough on our own.
------------------------------------------------
[00000138][パニス,char_002 Panis]
If you have any leftover, share it with the sheep!
------------------------------------------------
[00000139][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, marinated sheep and fish.
It's no good if you let me eat it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000140][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Surplus food should be refrigerated and taken home.
It seems ideal, but
Unfortunately, there is no way to refrigerate it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000141][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
If that's the case, I'll just have to try my best to eat it.
Hey guys, eat with enthusiasm!
------------------------------------------------
[00000142][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Why do you only feed us?
I might as well eat it myself.
------------------------------------------------
[00000143][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
After all, I'm on a diet.
------------------------------------------------
[00000144][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I'm almost at my limit...
------------------------------------------------
[00000145][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Well, the act of wasting food is
Although it goes against Justice...
I'm already feeling sick to my stomach...
------------------------------------------------
[00000146][パニス,char_002 Panis]
It's delicious when we all eat together!
------------------------------------------------
[00000147][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Panis... just eat that...
Why are you so cheerful...
------------------------------------------------
[00000148][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Okay, okay.
Sheep-san, good job!
------------------------------------------------
[00000149][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis, that sheep is your favorite.
------------------------------------------------
[00000150][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah!
It's fluffy and fluffy and smells like sunflowers!
------------------------------------------------
[00000151][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Even if I'm being caressed so roughly,
I don't think you dislike it at all.
------------------------------------------------
[00000152][ピーター,char_520]
Let Panis pet you,
The sheep is also happy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000153][パニス,char_002 Panis]
real!?
Are you happy, sheep?
------------------------------------------------
[00000154][パニス,char_002 Panis]
……a! He's saying yes!
------------------------------------------------
[00000155][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed! older sister!
Let's take this sheep home!
------------------------------------------------
[00000156][フリード,char_001 Fried]
eh!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000157][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I know how you feel, but...
It's impossible for me to keep such a big animal at home.
------------------------------------------------
[00000158][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Eh, why?
He's such a quiet and nice boy.
It's great even at home!
------------------------------------------------
[00000159][ピーター,char_520]
But when you are taken away,
I'll be in trouble too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000160][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis, will you take care of it?
I'll give you some food too
I can even take you to the bath!
------------------------------------------------
[00000161][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's not the problem...
Hmm, I'm in trouble.
------------------------------------------------
[00000162][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Panis.
Panis is living apart from me and Freed.
You don't like it, do you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000163][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Eh...yeah. No way!
Panis, that's so lonely!
------------------------------------------------
[00000164][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
The same goes for this sheep.
If you live apart from your friends and Peter,
I'm sure you'll miss me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000165][パニス,char_002 Panis]
……Is that so?
------------------------------------------------
[00000166][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree.
I think it would be better for the sheep to live on this large pasture.
------------------------------------------------
[00000167][ピーター,char_520]
Panis.
If you come here, you can play with the sheep anytime.
Isn't that bad?
------------------------------------------------
[00000168][パニス,char_002 Panis]
……O.K. I understand!
Panis is coming to play again!
See you soon, Sheep!
------------------------------------------------
[00000169][デボラ,char_512]
Okay, okay, he's a good boy.
Now, let's brush it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000170][パニス,char_002 Panis]
huh……
------------------------------------------------
[00000171][デボラ,char_512]
What is it? Panis-chan is
She is brushing the sheep,
Hasn't she seen it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000172][パニス,char_002 Panis]
No. But...what Grandma Deborah is doing is...
He saw it for the first time.
------------------------------------------------
[00000173][デボラ,char_512]
Haha, is that so?
Grandma sometimes does things like this.
He's here to help out on the farm.
------------------------------------------------
[00000174][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Is that so?
Well then, maybe Grandma...
Is that Peter's grandma?
------------------------------------------------
[00000175][デボラ,char_512]
Huh? Ahahahaha, that's wrong.
Baba is human, right?
A human grandma can't have a beastkin grandson.
------------------------------------------------
[00000176][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hmm...
That's right……
------------------------------------------------
[00000177][デボラ,char_512]
Fufufu...
But, Peter...
And Panis-chan and the other kids too...
------------------------------------------------
[00000178][デボラ,char_512]
For Grandma Deborah and Grandpa Boris,
They're as cute as real grandchildren, aren't they?
------------------------------------------------
[00000179][デボラ,char_512]
Also, the animals that support village life.
That's why Grandma helps Peter.
------------------------------------------------
[00000180][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hmm...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000181][デボラ,char_512]
Oh, was it a little difficult for Panis-chan?
------------------------------------------------
[00000182][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah...just a little.
But, you know what?
------------------------------------------------
[00000183][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I love Panis, Grandpa and Grandpa!
Also, the animals too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000184][デボラ,char_512]
Hahaha! As long as you understand that properly, you'll be fine.
Panis-chan is a smart, good girl.
------------------------------------------------
[00000185][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Ehehe...
Thank you, Grandma!
------------------------------------------------
[00000186][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Peter, why are you doing that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000187][ピーター,char_520]
that? This is a bad insect that sticks to your body.
I'm chasing them away.
------------------------------------------------
[00000188][フリード,char_001 Fried]
There are many sheep,
Brushing is also a pain.
------------------------------------------------
[00000189][ピーター,char_520]
Well.
But all my sheep are quiet.
It's not that hard.
------------------------------------------------
[00000190][パニス,char_002 Panis]
The sheep look comfortable...
------------------------------------------------
[00000191][ピーター,char_520]
I agree.
After all, it would be itchy if there were insects.
------------------------------------------------
[00000192][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Peter!
I would also like to “brushy” Panis!
------------------------------------------------
[00000193][ピーター,char_520]
"Brushing".
Hmm, that's right...
I wonder if it's okay if it's a small child over there.
------------------------------------------------
[00000194][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yay! Yay!
Sheep, come on!
------------------------------------------------
[00000195][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Ah, here it comes.
------------------------------------------------
[00000196][ピーター,char_520]
Okay, then this is a brush.
Please be kind to me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000197][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yes!
Good, good...
------------------------------------------------
[00000198][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis is good at brushing.
The sheep is wagging its tail happily.
------------------------------------------------
[00000199][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Really!? I’m so happy!
Good, good...
------------------------------------------------
[00000200][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Levin!
------------------------------------------------
[00000201][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
yeah? Would you like to take a walk with Freed?
------------------------------------------------
[00000202][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000203][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Well.
It's like going for a walk and inspecting the village.
------------------------------------------------
[00000204][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Shisatsu...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000205][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I mean, I'm just waiting and watching.
The way everyone in the village lives.
------------------------------------------------
[00000206][パニス,char_002 Panis]
So, who are you watching?
------------------------------------------------
[00000207][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
yeah?
------------------------------------------------
[00000208][パニス,char_002 Panis]
You know, Panis and the animals?
I know how you live!
------------------------------------------------
[00000209][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
No... that's why...
------------------------------------------------
[00000210][パニス,char_002 Panis]
The animals eat grass!
They even drink water at the pond!
------------------------------------------------
[00000211][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Then Peter messes with me!
When I do that, she gets happy and cries something like “mee!”
------------------------------------------------
[00000212][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hehe, I see...
Do you squeal?
------------------------------------------------
[00000213][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah!
------------------------------------------------
[00000214][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
...There was no need to inspect it.
There don't seem to be any problems living on this island.
After all, it's a place you should get your hands on eventually.
------------------------------------------------
[00000215][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Levin...
------------------------------------------------
[00000216][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hahaha, don't look so worried.
Eventually, I guess.
------------------------------------------------
[00000217][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
For now……
At best, I'll let you take it easy!
------------------------------------------------
[00000218][ピーター,char_520]
Hey Levin.
There's something I've always wanted to ask you,
Is it okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000219][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Oh, what?
------------------------------------------------
[00000220][ピーター,char_520]
It's about the animals of the continent.
What do the chickens and sheep over there look like?
I heard that there are some strange types.
------------------------------------------------
[00000221][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
That's right...I can't say it in one word.
It's a vast continent, even chickens and sheep...
There are various types depending on the land.
------------------------------------------------
[00000222][ピーター,char_520]
I see...
------------------------------------------------
[00000223][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
What, you want to see the animals of the continent?
Anyway, next time I set sail,
Is it okay if I give you a ride to the continent?
------------------------------------------------
[00000224][ピーター,char_520]
picture? I was wondering if I could keep it on my farm.
------------------------------------------------
[00000225][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
At the ranch?
------------------------------------------------
[00000226][ピーター,char_520]
Yeah. The way they are raised, the texture of their fur, and the way their breasts come out...
I wonder how it's different.
------------------------------------------------
[00000227][ピーター,char_520]
Also, if you can keep different kinds of animals,
It will be useful to everyone in the village...
------------------------------------------------
[00000228][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hehe...I see.
Does that mean you have no intention of leaving the village?
------------------------------------------------
[00000229][ピーター,char_520]
Yeah. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000230][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
There's no need to apologize. Every human being,
It's best to live where you like.
------------------------------------------------
[00000231][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Perhaps the animals of the continent, too.
If you bring me here, maybe you'll like it here.
------------------------------------------------
[00000232][ピーター,char_520]
That's true!
------------------------------------------------
[00000233][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Okay, next time I go to the continent,
I'll bring you some! Look forward to it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000234][ピーター,char_520]
Really!? Thank you, Levin!
------------------------------------------------
[00000235][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
It's a peaceful landscape.
It feels like peace itself.
------------------------------------------------
[00000236][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Oh, absolutely.
------------------------------------------------
[00000237][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Is that Levin and Viola?
It's a rare combination...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000238][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
……in?
Sister, how long do you plan to stay here?
------------------------------------------------
[00000239][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Isn't that my choice?
Well, I plan to go home before sunset.
------------------------------------------------
[00000240][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
That's not what it means.
How long do you intend to stay in this village?
------------------------------------------------
[00000241][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
...That's just my choice.
You are the village you plan to occupy,
How long do you plan on getting to know each other?
------------------------------------------------
[00000242][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I don't mean to get acquainted with each other.
Besides, no matter how I act,
That's up to me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000243][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (This is a rather disturbing conversation...
Maybe I should stop it...? )
------------------------------------------------
[00000244][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000245][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000246][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
...So, how long do you plan on doing this?
It doesn't matter what the village is like,
About being absent-minded here.
------------------------------------------------
[00000247][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Isn't that good?
Please enjoy the scenery of the village for a while.
------------------------------------------------
[00000248][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
This place has a really nice view.
...It's not just a view. animals, climate,
The guys in the village are all the best.
------------------------------------------------
[00000249][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
...If you like it that much
Why do you want to occupy it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000250][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
There's no reason.
Get what you want. That's it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000251][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
That's just a selfish phrase.
What would the villagers say if they asked?
------------------------------------------------
[00000252][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
The villagers will be grateful.
I'm the one who said I'll protect you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000253][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Isn't the story contradictory?
Do you want to take over the village? Do you want to protect it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000254][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
It's both.
I like it, so I want it.
I like it, so I want to protect it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000255][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I wanted to protect the village with my hands,
The whole village is in my hands,
Isn't that the quickest way?
------------------------------------------------
[00000256][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
...I was stunned.
It's a wild way of thinking, very pirate-like.
------------------------------------------------
[00000257][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
but……
"I like it so I'll protect it", huh?
It's not bad.
------------------------------------------------
[00000258][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (I thought it was going to start with a fight though)
That doesn't seem to be the case)
------------------------------------------------
[00000259][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (And...they both have their own ways.
It seems like he's thinking about the village...
...I'm a little happy)
------------------------------------------------
