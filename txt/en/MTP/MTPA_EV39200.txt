[00000000][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hey Panis, sometimes instead of Freed,
Would you like to spend some time with me?
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][パニス,char_002 Panis]
How?
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
picture? Yeah, um...
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Pa, panis is always free
You're playing with it, right?
So, why don't you give Freed a day off once in a while?
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I see, Freed is always for Panis.
They can do a lot of things for you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][フリード,char_001 Fried]
never mind. My sister is the one who takes a break from baking once in a while.
How about going out somewhere?
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
nothing……!
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I-I'm fine too. I love baking bread,
In fact, I don't want to take a break.
So Panis, shall we bake bread together?
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis, I want to eat the bread that Freed baked.
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But Panis, Shannon
Even though you invited me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][パニス,char_002 Panis]
So let's all bake bread together!
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I'm fine, but...
How is your sister?
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...Okay, okay.
If you two are okay with that, then I...
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
@fcFFAAFFAA (The two of us are always too close to each other, so sometimes
I can't say I just wanted you to leave...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Phew...
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][フリード,char_001 Fried]
In the end, it's the same as always.
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
a……
Yes, hehehe...
As always, we're all together.
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
@fcFFAAFFAA (No matter what,
I guess this is the best after all...
We're all better together...right? )
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][リアン,char_514]
Here we go!
Special cream donut!
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Wow! looks delicious!
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][リアン,char_514]
Right? It's also very popular with customers.
Come on, Panis, Hiram, help me.
We need to put donuts on store shelves.
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][ハイラム,char_513]
let's see?
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][リアン,char_514]
a! It's not okay, just eat a snack!
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][ハイラム,char_513]
No, just have a taste...
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][リアン,char_514]
You tasted it earlier!
It can't be helped, you.
Because it's always like that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][ハイラム,char_513]
No, it's embarrassing...
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][リアン,char_514]
Not at all.
Even though Panis is helping me properly,
If you're like that...
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][パニス,char_002 Panis]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][リアン,char_514]
fault……? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Mmmmmmm...
……Fe?
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][リアン,char_514]
Pa, panis...? What about donuts...?
Maybe... you ate it?
...Everything!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][リアン,char_514]
It was delicious...hey!
Panis, it's no good!
I ate the bread from the shop!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][パニス,char_002 Panis]
sorry……
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][リアン,char_514]
Will you be careful next time?
More importantly, is your stomach okay after eating so much?
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah, come on!
The donuts were so delicious!
I love Auntie's donuts, Panis!
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][リアン,char_514]
Really, already.
Hehehe... it's no match for Panis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][リアン,char_514]
Now, let's make it again.
Panis, can you help me?
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yes!
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Sister, what's wrong?
Looks like you're quite busy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Freed, Panis! To a good place!
There have been a lot of customers since this morning.
Please, can you help me?
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis, let's do it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Of course I'll help you too.
What should I start with?
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
thank you! Panis was tending the shop there.
Freed, there's just bread in the oven...
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][ガルゼー,char_501]
I'll disturb you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Oh, it's Soncho!
Welcome!
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][ガルゼー,char_501]
Oh, Panis-chan.
Can you help me? That's great.
Shannon, I need 12 pieces of bread.
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Well, wait a minute.
Freshly baked just now...
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][アリーゼ,char_504]
Please excuse me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Alise has arrived this time!
Welcome!
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][アリーゼ,char_504]
The store has run out of stock.
I'd like nine pieces of bread, please.
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hey, wait a minute.
Well, in that case, it's just bread in the oven.
We'll run out, so prepare...
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][マイア,char_503]
Hello.
Because it smells so good
I just happened to stop by. Can I get two?
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][ロドリゴ,char_517]
I'll disturb you!
I'll order six servings of lunch for the vigilante group's night watch!
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Is it about time for the bread to bake?
I ordered only three freshly baked items.
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...Uuuuuuu!
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Sister, what's wrong?
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Fu, Freed! I can't do it anymore!
The bread! How much bread do you need?
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Huh!? You suddenly said something like that...!
Eh, um, the village chief has 10...
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][ガルゼー,char_501]
There are 12 pieces.
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][アリーゼ,char_504]
There are nine here.
Oh, I'm sorry~
After all, 8 pieces is enough, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Um, wait a minute?
Sister! It's my sister!
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Well, 12 pieces instead of 10.
9 became 8...
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Sister! Don't worry about the math, just bake some bread!
Sister!
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hmph♪　Hmph♪　Hmph♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][フリード,char_001 Fried]
You're in a good mood, sister.
Did something happen?
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Yeah! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Gah!!)
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It's about to be cooked, so give it a taste, Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Well, I'm looking forward to that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Oh, it looks burnt!
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Ah...
Come to think of it, I have some delivery work to do somewhere.
Isn't there one?
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Not now.
This is better than that! Enjoy freshly baked!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, oh. thank you……
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
here we go! copper?
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][フリード,char_001 Fried]
…………………
...It's a unique taste.
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
delicious?
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][フリード,char_001 Fried]
The taste, texture, smell, and appearance,
Because it's original, innovative, and has a strong personality...
I guess it's a little difficult for the general public to accept...
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
So, is it delicious?
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Well, that...
To be honest...I think it's a failure.
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Sorry!
------------------------------------------------
[00000083][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Yeah...I can't help it.
I'll try again and think of something else.
------------------------------------------------
[00000084][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No……
------------------------------------------------
[00000085][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Really, Shannon's new recipe is a gamble...
It's also a bad gamble that 90% of the time fails...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000086][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
At that time, please taste it again.
------------------------------------------------
[00000087][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Ah, yeah...
------------------------------------------------
[00000088][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hey Hey! Let's play! Let's play with Panis!
------------------------------------------------
[00000089][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
It's okay, Mr. Panis.
So what should we do for fun?
------------------------------------------------
[00000090][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Well, play house!
Panis is your mother. And Adam is a baby!
------------------------------------------------
[00000091][フリード,char_001 Fried]
……picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000092][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I got it. Babu, babu, babu!
------------------------------------------------
[00000093][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yes, Adam is a good boy, isn't he?
I'll give you some milk now, okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000094][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Babu, babu, babu!
Manma, manma, manma!
------------------------------------------------
[00000095][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (...it's a pretty big and tough baby)
------------------------------------------------
[00000096][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Did you drink all the milk?
Isn't it great?
Well then, let's take a nap, shall we?
------------------------------------------------
[00000097][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Babu, babu!
------------------------------------------------
[00000098][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Oh dear? Well then, why don't you let daddy play with you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000099][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture? "Dad...do you mean me!?"
------------------------------------------------
[00000100][パニス,char_002 Panis]
yes! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000101][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Eh, eh, eh! Hey, wait a minute!
The fact that I'm the father means that Panis and I are...
They say they are a couple... um, um...
------------------------------------------------
[00000102][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Come on, Adam
Shall I have my dad give me a piggyback ride?
------------------------------------------------
[00000103][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, even if you suddenly call me dad,
I'm mentally prepared...but if Panis is like that...
yeah……?  what did you say?
------------------------------------------------
[00000104][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Babu! Piggyback!
------------------------------------------------
[00000105][フリード,char_001 Fried]
circle! Impossible! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000106][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Babu!
------------------------------------------------
[00000107][フリード,char_001 Fried]
circle! Wow!
------------------------------------------------
[00000108][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, zero.
------------------------------------------------
[00000109][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Shannon, you're ready.
Please take this bread dough to the oven.
------------------------------------------------
[00000110][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I got it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000111][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Adam, what time are you keeping track of?
------------------------------------------------
[00000112][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
This is the aging time of the bread dough.
------------------------------------------------
[00000113][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I don't really understand the reasoning, but
When I asked Adam to measure the time,
The bread is baked fluffy and delicious.
------------------------------------------------
[00000114][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I see!
Adam, that's amazing!
------------------------------------------------
[00000115][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What kind of logic is that?
If you have a reason, please let me know as well.
------------------------------------------------
[00000116][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
It's not that difficult of a theory.
By fermenting the bread dough for an appropriate amount of time,
This will bring the fabric to its optimum condition.
------------------------------------------------
[00000117][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Tasteful...? Hakko...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000118][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Fermentation in this case means that the bacteria in the bread dough
It refers to breeding to a suitable number.
------------------------------------------------
[00000119][パニス,char_002 Panis]
What is Kin?
------------------------------------------------
[00000120][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
It is a very small creature that cannot be seen with the naked eye.
The yeast or yeast you are adding is
In the first place, it is a general term for fungi...
------------------------------------------------
[00000121][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Is kin...a living thing?
When you eat bread, the “kin” also
Shall we eat together?
------------------------------------------------
[00000122][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Adam, is that true?
Before we know it,
Were you eating such strange things?
------------------------------------------------
[00000123][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Sorry to hear that's weird.
Adam, that "kin" is...
Can I think of it as something like a spirit?
------------------------------------------------
[00000124][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I agree……
It can also be compared like that,
It's not impossible, but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000125][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I see.
In other words, the invisible spirit of bread is at work,
Does it make bread delicious?
------------------------------------------------
[00000126][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's what "Hakko" means.
Adam was keeping track of time.
He was waiting for the spirits to finish their work.
------------------------------------------------
[00000127][パニス,char_002 Panis]
great!
Good luck, bread spirit!
------------------------------------------------
[00000128][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
@fcFFAAFFAA (This is just an example,
Bacteria and spirits are strictly different...
Everyone seems to agree, so let's say it's okay.)
------------------------------------------------
[00000129][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hey Kilmaria. Would you like to try baking bread?
------------------------------------------------
[00000130][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
picture? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000131][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Yeah.
If it's Mr. Kilmaria, I'm sure I won't have it.
I think you can bake delicious bread with free ideas.
------------------------------------------------
[00000132][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I-Is that so?
Actually, I always eat just bread.
I've been wanting to try baking it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000133][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...Justice, Pan?
------------------------------------------------
[00000134][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
yes!
It is the bread of justice that saves the people of the world!
------------------------------------------------
[00000135][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Immediately, I came up with an idea that was too free...
Such magnificent bread is made in my oven.
Will it burn...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000136][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
……in?
What kind of bread is it exactly?
------------------------------------------------
[00000137][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
That's right...
People can be happy just by eating...
I would love to bake bread like that!
------------------------------------------------
[00000138][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hmm...it's still a little vague, isn't it?
By the way, Kilmaria-san,
What kind of bread do you think will make you happy?
------------------------------------------------
[00000139][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
When I received the cream bread earlier,
I feel so happy!
It's so sweet that you can't help but smile...
------------------------------------------------
[00000140][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Ah, but,
Meat or fish bread will also make you happy!
------------------------------------------------
[00000141][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Unlike sweet bread,
How can I say this?
Let's just say I'm happy that my stomach is calming...
------------------------------------------------
[00000142][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Of course, there's nothing in it.
Eating bread and other foods will make you happy!
I feel a warm feeling of happiness, like a sense of security!
------------------------------------------------
[00000143][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...In other words, you can eat any kind of bread.
Does it mean to be happy?
------------------------------------------------
[00000144][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Apparently so.
------------------------------------------------
[00000145][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
...Ha! That means,
All the breads that Shannon bakes are
Does that mean it's just bread?
------------------------------------------------
[00000146][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
That’s great, Shannon!
From now on, for the happiness of people around the world,
Please do your best!
------------------------------------------------
[00000147][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hahaha...I'll do my best...
------------------------------------------------
[00000148][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Adam, and Shannon and Zynga...
what happened?
------------------------------------------------
[00000149][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Oh, Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000150][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Actually, I'm currently adjusting my schedule.
------------------------------------------------
[00000151][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What do you mean?
------------------------------------------------
[00000152][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Later, I asked Adam to go to the bakery.
I wanted you to help me, but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000153][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
At that time, I was also at the fishing grounds.
I wanted to borrow Adam's hand.
------------------------------------------------
[00000154][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Even if I try to adjust the time,
We also have help in other places,
It just doesn't go well.
------------------------------------------------
[00000155][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I see.
Adam, you're in demand everywhere.
------------------------------------------------
[00000156][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
When it comes to this,
One of us has no choice but to give up...
------------------------------------------------
[00000157][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's right. Will it be decided by rock-paper-scissors or something?
------------------------------------------------
[00000158][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Please wait. Mr. Shannon, Mr. Zinga,
Try clapping my hands.
------------------------------------------------
[00000159][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
hand?
------------------------------------------------
[00000160][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Adam's head is spinning!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000161][パニス,char_002 Panis]
great!
------------------------------------------------
[00000162][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
He turned towards me and stopped...
------------------------------------------------
[00000163][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
congratulations. ...So, using this function of mine,
Why not settle it in three rounds?
------------------------------------------------
[00000164][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
No……
------------------------------------------------
[00000165][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Adam, you can do something like this...
------------------------------------------------
[00000166][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yes, I was surprised...
------------------------------------------------
[00000167][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Uncle Aunt! I’m home!
------------------------------------------------
[00000168][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It's not "I'm home!"
What time do you think it is now!? Where were you eating road grass!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000169][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture? I was playing with Panis and it got a little late...
------------------------------------------------
[00000170][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Dinner is already ready.
The bread has become really hard!
------------------------------------------------
[00000171][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Sister, you're in a really bad mood today...
Did something happen?
------------------------------------------------
[00000172][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It’s nothing!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000173][ハイラム,char_513]
As for Shannon, they're both coming home late.
I was worried.
------------------------------------------------
[00000174][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hey, dad!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000175][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, was that so?
------------------------------------------------
[00000176][リアン,char_514]
Yes, that's right.
Because Shannon is worried too much.
I'm thinking of going there to find it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000177][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Or even my mother...
------------------------------------------------
[00000178][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is that so……
Sister, aunt, uncle, I'm sorry.
------------------------------------------------
[00000179][パニス,char_002 Panis]
sorry……
------------------------------------------------
[00000180][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Well, nothing happened, so that's enough!
T-Be careful next time!? Okay!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000181][ハイラム,char_513]
Hahaha.
Besides, aren't you both hungry?
------------------------------------------------
[00000182][リアン,char_514]
Well, let's have dinner soon.
------------------------------------------------
[00000183][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah!
Panis, I'm hungry!
------------------------------------------------
[00000184][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I'm hungry too.
By the way, today my sister
It was my turn to bake bread.
------------------------------------------------
[00000185][フリード,char_001 Fried]
My sister's bread is delicious even when it's cold,
You can eat a lot.
------------------------------------------------
[00000186][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What?
Even if you flatter me now, you won't improve my mood!
------------------------------------------------
[00000187][ハイラム,char_513]
Hahahaha.
Okay, let's eat quickly.
I'm also hungry.
------------------------------------------------
[00000188][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yes, that's right.
Panis, let's go home quickly.
------------------------------------------------
[00000189][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah!
------------------------------------------------
[00000190][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Bread is a really convenient food.
Knead it up and throw it in the oven
Anyone can get burned.
------------------------------------------------
[00000191][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hey, I can't ignore what you just said!
Please don't neglect my job of baking bread!?
It's very difficult!
------------------------------------------------
[00000192][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It doesn't look like that at all, does it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000193][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It's not because I'm not looking properly!
Don't say bullshit without knowing me!
------------------------------------------------
[00000194][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I'm watching it and I know it.
It's as easy as baking bread for me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000195][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
If that's what you're talking about, what's here is
Feel free to use it as you like, so give it a try!
------------------------------------------------
[00000196][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Okay, let's bake it for you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000197][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (It seems like it's sticking out quite a bit...
Is it really okay? Mr. Velvet...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000198][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
...Well, it's burnt.
After all, it wasn't at all difficult, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000199][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Well then, Freed, let's have it together.
------------------------------------------------
[00000200][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah.
Well then, I'll have it...
…………Th-This is……!
------------------------------------------------
[00000201][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
………!?
……Th-This is……!
------------------------------------------------
[00000202][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Oh, it's delicious!
Hey, how did you bake it?
Tell me the recipe!
------------------------------------------------
[00000203][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
There's nothing like that.
Knead it carefully,
I just threw it in the oven.
------------------------------------------------
[00000204][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That’s it!
Don't be mean, tell me!
------------------------------------------------
[00000205][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I-I don't know, even I...
Really, the scale and atmosphere,
I just did it properly!
------------------------------------------------
[00000206][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Well then, try it one more time!
I'll be sure to take notes!
------------------------------------------------
[00000207][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
No, that's it! I mean, it's impossible!
Please give me a break!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000208][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (I can't believe it's so delicious just by grilling it properly...
It's a talent that should be forgotten...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000209][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Killmaria, are you helping Adam?
------------------------------------------------
[00000210][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Ah, Mr. Panis and Mr. Freed.
That's right. I'm helping out on the farm.
------------------------------------------------
[00000211][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Have you become interested in plants?
------------------------------------------------
[00000212][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
The flora of this island is truly unique.
Because it's very interesting.
------------------------------------------------
[00000213][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I classify plant specimens and data,
Mr. Kilmaria keeps records of their growth.
This is the record.
------------------------------------------------
[00000214][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Wow! That's a huge amount!
Did Kilmaria record all of this?
As expected...
------------------------------------------------
[00000215][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
No, not that much.
We also had the cooperation of Adam.
------------------------------------------------
[00000216][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But you kept records and sketched every morning, right?
It's amazing...the plants that grow on the island are
I've recorded most of it, haven't I?
------------------------------------------------
[00000217][パニス,char_002 Panis]
what happened?
------------------------------------------------
[00000218][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Only Candy Seed has no records.
Didn't find it?
I think it's a grass seed that grows everywhere...
------------------------------------------------
[00000219][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
no. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000220][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Shall Panis fetch it for you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000221][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
That's not true! I asked Adam,
We collected a lot of seeds.
...Isn't it? Mr. Adam.
------------------------------------------------
[00000222][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
yes.
By the way, I had secured a large amount...
------------------------------------------------
[00000223][フリード,char_001 Fried]
So why?
------------------------------------------------
[00000224][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
That seed...isn't it sweet and delicious?
------------------------------------------------
[00000225][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000226][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I also ate it a lot when I was little.
It's perfect for a snack...
...So, by any chance, is it Kill Maria-san?
------------------------------------------------
[00000227][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Ha, yes...actually, everything was done before I raised it...
It's so delicious...
Aaaaaaaaaa! What I did...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000228][フリード,char_001 Fried]
oh dear……
I know how you feel though...
------------------------------------------------
[00000229][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Yeah? That's...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000230][バッカス,char_527]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000231][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (hiding over there, glancing at me,
It's Bacchus, right? )
------------------------------------------------
[00000232][バッカス,char_527]
...Chickkisho~!
Isn't it a nice smell...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000233][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Bacchus?
What are you doing in a place like that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000234][バッカス,char_527]
Huh, Freed!?
No, no, that's not it...What do you mean?
I-I can't be Bacchus or anything like that, can I?
------------------------------------------------
[00000235][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, just changing your tone won't fool you.
Did you come to buy bread?
------------------------------------------------
[00000236][バッカス,char_527]
No, no! It's definitely different!
No matter how much I want to eat delicious bread,
My pride, such as shopping at a rival store...
------------------------------------------------
[00000237][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Don't worry about that, come here.
Is my bread delicious?
------------------------------------------------
[00000238][バッカス,char_527]
That's why...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000239][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Welcome!
It's your first time coming to our house, isn't it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000240][バッカス,char_527]
……picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000241][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Sister?
------------------------------------------------
[00000242][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I don't know who you are, but
We welcome everyone!
------------------------------------------------
[00000243][バッカス,char_527]
Oh, really? No, how about goodbye?
Is it okay if I buy some bread?
------------------------------------------------
[00000244][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Yes, of course.
All of our breads are products we are proud of.
Customer, which one will you choose?
------------------------------------------------
[00000245][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (...I see, if you're stupid like that,
Is it easy for Bacchus to buy bread?
As expected of you, sister! )
------------------------------------------------
[00000246][バッカス,char_527]
Hey, hey.
So, here and there...
Then I'll take that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000247][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Yes, thank you very much!
To prevent the bread from getting crushed,
Please be careful when taking it home!
------------------------------------------------
[00000248][バッカス,char_527]
Oh, oh. I can't stand it.
...Gufufufufu.
------------------------------------------------
[00000249][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Bacchus looks happy...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000250][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
We look forward to your continued patronage!
Don't sneak around this time,
Come with dignity, Bakasu♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000251][バッカス,char_527]
Giku!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000252][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
This, that, and this...
------------------------------------------------
[00000253][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Looks like you're busy, sis.
Shall I help?
------------------------------------------------
[00000254][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Thank you, Freed.
Well then, would you like me to taste it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000255][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture……?
Could that be...
------------------------------------------------
[00000256][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I've created a new recipe!
------------------------------------------------
[00000257][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Gah!!)
------------------------------------------------
[00000258][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Well, I hope it cooks well.
------------------------------------------------
[00000259][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I feel like it's going to be really delicious this time!
------------------------------------------------
[00000260][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I thought it was bad from the beginning.
I don't think there's anyone who bakes it...huh?
------------------------------------------------
[00000261][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
copper? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000262][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's true……!
------------------------------------------------
[00000263][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Okay, it's okay.
Now, enjoy your freshly baked food.
------------------------------------------------
[00000264][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No……
------------------------------------------------
[00000265][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (It does smell really delicious...
No, it's not just the smell! I'm sure it will taste good too!
I believe in my sister...! )
------------------------------------------------
[00000266][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I'll enjoy having this……
…………yeah!
------------------------------------------------
[00000267][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
copper?
------------------------------------------------
[00000268][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's perfect, sis...!
Since when was the last time something tasted so delicious?
------------------------------------------------
[00000269][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Yay ♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000270][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I will never forget this emotion!
I'm so happy to have stumbled upon such a jackpot!
------------------------------------------------
[00000271][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Ugh...Thank you, Freed.
I will continue to do my best!
------------------------------------------------
[00000272][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Ah, but until I get lucky again...
I feel a little dizzy thinking about the far and steep road...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000273][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hmm...
------------------------------------------------
[00000274][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What's wrong, Velvet?
Why are you staring at Adam?
------------------------------------------------
[00000275][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hey, there's something that bothers me.
Hey Adam, why doesn't your body rust?
------------------------------------------------
[00000276][パニス,char_002 Panis]
rust?
------------------------------------------------
[00000277][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
that's right. However, being blown by the sea breeze on an island like this,
Even if you go on a boat and bathe in seawater, it won't rust, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000278][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What the hell is going on?!
------------------------------------------------
[00000279][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
If that's the case...
My body is not made of iron.
------------------------------------------------
[00000280][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Huh? Is that so?
------------------------------------------------
[00000281][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It looks like iron though...
------------------------------------------------
[00000282][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Although it looks and feels very similar to steel,
It's actually made from a special alloy.
It is much stronger than steel and is also resistant to corrosion.
------------------------------------------------
[00000283][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I don't really understand it, but
It's sturdy anyway.
------------------------------------------------
[00000284][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I see...
The technology of ancient civilizations is amazing.
That's why Adam is strong.
------------------------------------------------
[00000285][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Thank you for your time.
------------------------------------------------
[00000286][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That means it's made of the same material as Adam's body.
If you want to make some weapons,
You can make something that is very durable and sharp...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000287][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Maybe, but Velvet-san...
Unfortunately, the blending ratio and refining method are
It is not recorded in my database.
------------------------------------------------
[00000288][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
...Hey, does that mean I can't make it now?
To the "power" I'm looking for
I thought it would be...
------------------------------------------------
[00000289][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Velvet-san, you have a lot to think about...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000290][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Oh, Freed, look!
Butterflies, there are butterflies!
------------------------------------------------
[00000291][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yes, it's true.
Butterflies at night are somehow mysterious.
------------------------------------------------
[00000292][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Butterfly, wait! Butterfly!
------------------------------------------------
[00000293][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Panis is crazy chasing butterflies.
So innocent and cute)
------------------------------------------------
[00000294][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yes!
Yay, I caught it!
...Huh? I was able to escape.
------------------------------------------------
[00000295][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (...now that I think about it)
It's been awfully quiet around me since a while ago.)
------------------------------------------------
[00000296][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (I see, there's no one else around.
...That's bad, my heart is suddenly pounding.)
------------------------------------------------
[00000297][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Butterfly-san, butterfly-san.
Where did you go?
------------------------------------------------
[00000298][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (The sky is full of stars, faint moonlight,
And then it was just Panis and me...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000299][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (...I can say that.
Now I can convey my honest feelings! )
------------------------------------------------
[00000300][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis!
Oh, about me, Panis...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000301][フリード,char_001 Fried]
……picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000302][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Ehehe...
My stomach growled.
------------------------------------------------
[00000303][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Ah... now that I think about it
I can already smell the delicious smell of baking bread.
It's drifting away...
------------------------------------------------
[00000304][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed, I'm hungry!
It's time to go home!
------------------------------------------------
[00000305][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Yeah, that's right. Shall we go home?
------------------------------------------------
[00000306][パニス,char_002 Panis]
yay!I wonder what we have for dinner today!
------------------------------------------------
[00000307][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (tohoho…)
------------------------------------------------
[00000308][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hey there, cutie.
Could you please help me find some bread?
------------------------------------------------
[00000309][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Levin came to my house to buy bread.
That's rare.
------------------------------------------------
[00000310][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Even pirates eat bread.
Isn't the bread here good?
Viola's sister was praising me a lot, wasn't it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000311][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
thank you.
In that case, I can choose the popular bread, but
Does Levin have any preferences?
------------------------------------------------
[00000312][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm not the one who eats it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000313][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
A present for someone?
------------------------------------------------
[00000314][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Well, that's about it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000315][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I got it.
So, this and this...
------------------------------------------------
[00000316][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
That one seems pretty sweet.
------------------------------------------------
[00000317][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Are you curious? Well then, I'll put it in.
------------------------------------------------
[00000318][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I'm sorry.
------------------------------------------------
[00000319][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hey, can I ask who you're giving the gift to?
------------------------------------------------
[00000320][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I'll try to answer, but I don't know his name.
This is the kid I just met.
------------------------------------------------
[00000321][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Why would you give bread to such a child?
------------------------------------------------
[00000322][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
He picked up my handkerchief that I accidentally dropped.
That's a thank you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000323][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Huh... it's polite.
------------------------------------------------
[00000324][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Really?
------------------------------------------------
[00000325][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Yes, then this!
------------------------------------------------
[00000326][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Thank you.
Well then, I'll give it to the kid.
------------------------------------------------
[00000327][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Levin is surprisingly kind.
That kind of thing,
I wish they would show it more...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000328][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Huh? Levin is on the farm. That's rare...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000329][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
...This farm has become quite splendid.
You'll do it, iron boy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000330][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
thank you.
However, without your cooperation,
I couldn't do much maintenance.
------------------------------------------------
[00000331][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Even so, you were the one who took the lead in the work, right?
It's a big deal. After all, you are
I don't know if they're better suited for farming than fighting.
------------------------------------------------
[00000332][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I'm happy. I think this is the most appropriate performance evaluation.
------------------------------------------------
[00000333][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Yeah, that one was good.
But...you're not only involved in agriculture.
I feel like it's also suitable for pirates.
------------------------------------------------
[00000334][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
What so?
------------------------------------------------
[00000335][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
ah. What do you think? When I return to the sea,
Would you like to come with me too?
------------------------------------------------
[00000336][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
In other words, to get on your ship...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000337][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
That's what happened.
Pirates aren't bad either, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000338][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I would appreciate your request, but I cannot do it.
I have Mr. Freed as my master...
------------------------------------------------
[00000339][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
And everyone in this village
I'm registered as a master mate.
I cannot leave my master or his companions behind.
------------------------------------------------
[00000340][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
……Really.
Well, if that's the case, I can't help it.
Should I give up on scouting you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000341][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
very sorry.
but……
On the other hand, I have a proposal for Mr. Levin.
------------------------------------------------
[00000342][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
yeah?
------------------------------------------------
[00000343][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Why not live in this village forever?
Mr. Freed and everyone in the village,
I think that's what you want.
------------------------------------------------
