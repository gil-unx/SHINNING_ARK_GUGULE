[00000000][バッカス,char_527]
Wow!
Bell, Velvet!
Uuuu... Hiccup...
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][バッカス,char_527]
Please, please come back!
We were supposed to be friends, right?
Let's try again, okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Yeah, you're saying that, but what are you going to do?
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I don't know anything about this.
When I was teaming up with that useless person,
There's nothing to gain.
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][バッカス,char_527]
Damn it... Hey, Freed!
Don't try to seduce my partner!
Bell, please, please come back!
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's like a man crying after being dumped.
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Isn't it just like that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It can't be helped.
It's troublesome to be followed,
Let's hand it over quickly.
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][バッカス,char_527]
Guah!?
Bell, why...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What's the point of "trying again", you useless person!
The duo didn't break up because you were lazy.
Please wake up!
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][バッカス,char_527]
Oh, that's it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I'm starting to feel sorry for Bacchus...
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][バッカス,char_527]
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu...
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
You've woken up a bit, haven't you?
You can say in your sleep that the duo is back together.
Come on, go home quickly.
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][バッカス,char_527]
Oh, I understand...
It was my fault...
Uuuuuuu...
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
This is the first time I've experienced such a heart-wrenching battle...
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Women are scary...
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Freed, did you say something?
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, no, it's nothing.
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
here? Is there a source of power in a place like this?
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
that's right.
There are many other places where it grows naturally,
This is where you can get the big ones.
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
There are so many!?
I've been looking for something like that...
My hardships...
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Before harvesting, first kill the monsters that are roaming around.
I have to do something.
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's right. Let's clean it up quickly.
Hey, Velvet-san, don't stay absent-minded.
Please help me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hmm...I don't quite agree with a lot of things, but...
It seems certain that the source of power can be obtained here.
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I got it. After kicking away the monsters that get in your way,
I'll give you the source of strength!
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I finally got it done!
Now, where is the source of power?
Please guide me to that place quickly!
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Don't panic so much.
I don't need any guidance.
Because they grow everywhere.
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
picture?What the hell are you talking about?
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, it's here too.
Well then, let's start digging.
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis is also great!
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What, what?
Everyone digs out the ground... What do you mean?
Is the source of power buried in such random places?
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Oh, this is so big!
Panis, be careful not to break it.
Are you going to dig quietly?
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah!
Good, good...good!
Freed, I got it! Under the power!
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's true! Well then, let's take it back to the village.
Professor Maia, I'm sure you'll be happy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Is that something like a yam the source of power?
……What do you mean?
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][マイア,char_503]
The flowers are in full bloom!
If this is all you have, you can send it to Alise-chan.
That's enough to thank you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
But...the monsters are in full bloom.
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's too dangerous for the teacher.
Shall we go and pick some?
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][マイア,char_503]
I feel happy but...
However, I would like to express my gratitude to everyone.
I want to pick it myself.
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
If that's the case,
Shall we ask the monster to leave?
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree.
Let's go, sister!
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Okay, the monster is gone.
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Now you can pick flowers with peace of mind.
Come on, Professor Maia. please.
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][フリード,char_001 Fried]
We're keeping an eye on the monsters,
Teacher, please pick slowly.
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][マイア,char_503]
Hehehe, thank you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
That's unusual, boy!
I never thought you guys would come out to intercept us with your ships!
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
From what I saw, it seems that the ship has been strengthened,
You can't fight just by looking good, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
You'll know right away if it's just for looks.
I don't know if he's a former admiral or not, but
Don't underestimate my guidance!
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
what? Haha, what an interesting lineup!
When did you change business?
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
There's something wrong with this too.
If you have time to talk,
Why don't you call me quickly?
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Zynga, is the ship ready?
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It's perfect! You can go anytime!
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I see……
Their ship handling skills and coordination are not bad either.
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hahahahaha!
This guy looks like he's going to have fun!
Come on, boy, let's get wet!
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Okay, I think I can win this!
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Don't let your guard down!
They haven't played their trump card yet!
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
You're doing quite well, boy!
But what about this one?
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
What!? What!? That big cannon!
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That's not good...
Everyone, be careful of that main gun!
If you take a direct hit, you won't be able to get away with it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Fufu...fufufufu...
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hahahahaha!
Ahhhhhhhhh!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Why, I laughed out loud like an idiot.
Did you go crazy after losing?
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
That's a big deal, Bell!
In such a short period of time, the amateurs of naval warfare
I wish I could grow this far!
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
And boy!
You all respond to Bell's guidance with all your might.
It's important!
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is that so?
I don't think it's that much...
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Aren't you happy to be praised by your enemies?
Is your opponent a pirate?
I don't know what you're thinking behind the scenes!
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
But, don't think you've won!
I'll fix the ship and come back again.
Don't forget that this island is mine!
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
See you guys! Let's meet again!
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Looks like the ruins are ahead.
Is everyone following properly?
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis, are you okay?
Just tell me when you're tired, okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis is absolutely terrible.
It's like a adventure and it's fun!
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hehehe.
Panis feels like an excursion.
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
But from now on, I feel like I'm going on an excursion.
I can't stay.
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Monsters are blocking the way.
It can't be helped, let's chase it away.
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It won't pass peacefully, will it?
Fine, whatever you want!
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
The problem is now gone.
Let's move on!
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
hang on!
Wait, Velvet!
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
It is dangerous to continue like this!
I think we should be careful here.
My Justice is whispering!
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
what is that! On such a flimsy basis
Don't get in my way!
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
There is evidence!
Don't you all feel it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Come to think of it, it seems a little too cold...
------------------------------------------------
[00000083][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
From the cold air flowing from the rocky mountains,
It is estimated that the temperature ahead will be quite low.
It is dangerous to proceed with your current equipment.
------------------------------------------------
[00000084][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Kilmaria and Adam are right.
Let's pull this up for now.
Why don't you come back again after preparing your equipment?
------------------------------------------------
[00000085][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That’s it!
How can I come this far and turn back?
I'm not kidding!
------------------------------------------------
[00000086][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
However, even if you are told that the equipment can withstand the cold,
What preparations should I make?
------------------------------------------------
[00000087][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Please do not worry about that.
I have an idea!
------------------------------------------------
[00000088][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Everyone, please go home and
Come to the village ruins after a while.
Let's meet up there.
------------------------------------------------
[00000089][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Understood. Mr. Velvet, is that okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000090][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I……
I understand now.
------------------------------------------------
[00000091][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I've finally reached this point.
It was long...
------------------------------------------------
[00000092][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Even though there's ice everywhere,
I don't feel cold at all.
Kilmaria-san is right.
------------------------------------------------
[00000093][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Fufufufu! how is it!
This is the power of Justice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000094][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Justice doesn't care though.
...Anyway, to a place like this
There are monsters roaming around.
------------------------------------------------
[00000095][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Monster, aren't you cold?
------------------------------------------------
[00000096][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Ah, it's so annoying!
Don't disturb me any more!
Get out of there quickly!
------------------------------------------------
[00000097][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It's over now, right?
There's no more hindrance, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000098][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
this is……
------------------------------------------------
[00000099][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Kilmaria-san, what's wrong?
------------------------------------------------
[00000100][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
it's amazing……
It could be amazing!
------------------------------------------------
[00000101][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
After all, this ruin
It seems like something important is hidden.
There is no doubt that you think so!
------------------------------------------------
[00000102][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Multiple flying objects were confirmed around the enemy.
It seems that the defense power is weaker than the main body.
------------------------------------------------
[00000103][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Well then, if it's that guy floating around,
Can it cause damage?
------------------------------------------------
[00000104][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
It's just a guess, but it's probably true.
------------------------------------------------
[00000105][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Okay! Everyone, that's what I heard.
Let's aim for that floating guy!
------------------------------------------------
[00000106][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
But there are many!
Do I have to destroy all of that!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000107][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That... I don't know.
I can't say for sure until I try it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000108][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I have to give it a try...that's irresponsible!
------------------------------------------------
[00000109][フリード,char_001 Fried]
There's no other way.
Velvet-san, please help me.
Make sure to destroy them one by one!
------------------------------------------------
[00000110][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Don't give me instructions!
...I understand now.
Just do it, just do it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000111][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I did it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000112][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I defeated the first one!
This will cause damage to the main body...
------------------------------------------------
[00000113][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
No, not yet.
Changes in the enemy body are only minor.
It seems like the attack isn't enough.
------------------------------------------------
[00000114][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Really……
Everyone, don't lose heart!
Let's aim for the next target!
------------------------------------------------
[00000115][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
No mutations can be confirmed on the enemy body.
------------------------------------------------
[00000116][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Not yet?
After all, it seems like I have to destroy everything...
------------------------------------------------
[00000117][フリード,char_001 Fried]
If you break them one by one, you'll be fine.
Everyone, don't give up!
------------------------------------------------
[00000118][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I broke something that looked like a feather!
------------------------------------------------
[00000119][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Although it seems that the special abilities he possesses have been suppressed,
Mutations to the enemy body are still not recognized.
------------------------------------------------
[00000120][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Looks like I'll have to destroy everything after all.
Alright, let's go, everyone!
------------------------------------------------
[00000121][フリード,char_001 Fried]
How about this……!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000122][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
You can see changes in the enemy body!
Defense ability is drastically reduced!
You can attack!
------------------------------------------------
[00000123][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I did it! Everyone, just one more breath!
But, there's something wrong with it...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000124][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
what's this……?
------------------------------------------------
[00000125][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
The enemy's energy response is increasing!
Take care of yourself, please!
------------------------------------------------
[00000126][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Damn it! Everyone, let's concentrate!
------------------------------------------------
[00000127][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I did it...I did it!
I defeated the monster!
------------------------------------------------
[00000128][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Is it finally over?
...It was long.
------------------------------------------------
[00000129][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Lie...I defeated it.
We are such a big thing...
unbelievable.
------------------------------------------------
[00000130][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
A big victory for Justice!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000131][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Beyond this is the place where the mural is located.
------------------------------------------------
[00000132][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I can't stay here even if I stay!
Now, let's hurry!
------------------------------------------------
[00000133][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Kilmaria, calm down!
Before that, we have to do something about the monsters!
------------------------------------------------
[00000134][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
In front of a monster of this level, Justice.
It won't cause any obstacles!
Let's clean it up quickly!
------------------------------------------------
[00000135][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Okay, is that all?
------------------------------------------------
[00000136][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Now let's check out the mural!
The discovery of the century is now at this moment!
------------------------------------------------
[00000137][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Killmaria-san, it's dangerous!
I have to make sure it's safe!
------------------------------------------------
[00000138][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...I don't think you can hear me.
------------------------------------------------
