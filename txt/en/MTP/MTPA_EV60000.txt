What's wrong, everyone?
What's on Panis' face?

amazing……
There was a hole in the mountain...
------------------------------------------------
[00000107][パニス,char_002 Panis]
why……
Those ruins were a little scary...
------------------------------------------------
[00000108][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Uncle Hans, I'm glad you're feeling better!
------------------------------------------------
[00000109][パニス,char_002 Panis]

Are you going to the other side of the mountain?
Is it different from before? What kind of place will it be this time?
------------------------------------------------
[00000111][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Even though it's the same island, the other side of the mountain is this way.
There's no difference at all...why?
------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
[00000115][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Who wrote that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000116][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Is that big one the same as Adam?
If that's the case, then he must have been a good boy...
------------------------------------------------
[00000117][パニス,char_002 Panis]
What did the island look like in the past?
------------------------------------------------
[00000118][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed... he looks scary...
Is it okay...? Do you want to have a tummy...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000119][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I guess it's okay...
Adam, I'm not feeling well...
------------------------------------------------
[00000120][パニス,char_002 Panis]
The story about Viola and the others is kind of difficult...
Panis, I don't understand.
------------------------------------------------
[00000121][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Why did Freed
I wonder if he can use that kind of power?
Will we find out soon?
------------------------------------------------
[00000122][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Sigh!
That shiny round thing was so beautiful!
------------------------------------------------

I see! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000129][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hmm... I'm sleepy...
------------------------------------------------
[00000130][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Is that so? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000131][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hey Freed? Are you okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000132][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hey, what are we going to do today?
------------------------------------------------
[00000133][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Well, I guess I'll bake some bread.
------------------------------------------------
[00000134][パニス,char_002 Panis]

Panis, I want to eat Fried's bread!
------------------------------------------------
[00000135][パニス,char_002 Panis]
First, I think I'll look for a request at the bar.
------------------------------------------------
[00000136][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Like, like! Let's go!
------------------------------------------------
[00000137][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hmm...I guess I should go home and sleep...
------------------------------------------------
[00000138][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah! Panis, I still want to play!
------------------------------------------------

Panis, Freed bread
You can eat as much as you want!
------------------------------------------------
[00000143][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Compared to my aunt and sister, I still have a long way to go.
------------------------------------------------
[00000144][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Well then, Freed-kun, calm down!
------------------------------------------------
[00000145][フリード,char_001 Fried]
where did you learn it? Those words...
------------------------------------------------
[00000146][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Well, it's better than Shannon's loss.
------------------------------------------------
[00000147][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis, don't you like that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000148][フリード,char_001 Fried]

Isn't your tongue weird?
------------------------------------------------

Ehehe...I guess so?
Thank you, Freed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000153][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I think it suits you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000154][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hooray! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000155][パニス,char_002 Panis]

Freed wins! Freed is strong!
------------------------------------------------
[00000167][パニス,char_002 Panis]

Hey, it's Aiko!
------------------------------------------------
[00000169][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hey, Freed.
A lot of the village was destroyed.
Will things go back to normal?
------------------------------------------------
[00000170][パニス,char_002 Panis]
of course! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000171][パニス,char_002 Panis]
That's true!
Well then, I'll help Panis too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000172][パニス,char_002 Panis]
It depends on our efforts.
------------------------------------------------
[00000173][パニス,char_002 Panis]
That's right...
Well then, let's do our best with panis too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000174][パニス,char_002 Panis]
If Panis does his best...
------------------------------------------------
[00000175][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis, what should I do?
Hmm...I don't really understand.
------------------------------------------------
[00000176][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed, why are you quiet?
After all... won't the village return to its original state?
------------------------------------------------
[00000177][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed, what is "Akuma"?
What kind of person are you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000178][パニス,char_002 Panis]
There are no devils in this village.
------------------------------------------------
[00000179][パニス,char_002 Panis]
That's right!
Well then, Kill Maria is wrong.
You came to this village!
------------------------------------------------
[00000180][パニス,char_002 Panis]
It's the exact opposite of Panis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000181][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hmm.
It's not called Panis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000182][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Still, Kilmaria is about Panis,
I was getting bored. Why?
------------------------------------------------
[00000183][パニス,char_002 Panis]
It's very scary.
------------------------------------------------
[00000184][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Kill Maria was talking about Panis...
...So, is Panis a scary person too?
------------------------------------------------
[00000185][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Don't you do freed too?
I see...then let's ask your sister later.
------------------------------------------------
[00000186][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed!
Velvet is such an interesting person!
Does Freed like Velvet?
------------------------------------------------
[00000187][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah, I like it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000188][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I see!
Panis also loves velvet!
------------------------------------------------
[00000189][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I don't know yet.
------------------------------------------------
[00000190][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed, don't you understand?
Panis likes Velvet though.
------------------------------------------------
[00000191][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I don't think I like it that much.
------------------------------------------------
[00000192][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed, do you hate Velvet?
Oh no...I hope we get along well...
------------------------------------------------
[00000193][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Still not sure?
Well then, if we become even better friends,
You'll fall in love with Velvet, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000194][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hey, Freed.
What was Freed like when he was little?
------------------------------------------------
[00000195][パニス,char_002 Panis]
He was an honest and good boy like Panis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000196][パニス,char_002 Panis]
That's right!
So, Panis is talking about Freed.
I'll do my best!
------------------------------------------------
[00000197][パニス,char_002 Panis]
She was a serious child who helped around the house.
------------------------------------------------
[00000198][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I see...
Well then, please help Panis a lot.
Become like Freed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000199][パニス,char_002 Panis]
He was an incorrigible mischievous child.
------------------------------------------------
[00000200][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I see...
Well then, Freed will become an uncle and an aunt.
I was scolded a lot...
------------------------------------------------
[00000201][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis, I don't like being scolded...
------------------------------------------------
[00000202][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed...don't you remember?
------------------------------------------------
[00000203][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I'm looking forward to the festival!
What will Freed do at the festival?
------------------------------------------------
[00000204][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I eat a lot of bread.
------------------------------------------------
[00000205][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Really!? I love panis and bread!
I also eat a lot of panis bread!
------------------------------------------------
[00000206][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Maybe I should get a toy by drawing lots.
------------------------------------------------
[00000207][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Lottery? Hey, is that it?
Will I get a toy if I enter the lottery?
------------------------------------------------
[00000208][パニス,char_002 Panis]
...Hey, Freed.
Panis, can I play with that toy too?
------------------------------------------------
[00000209][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I want to eat my fill of sweets.
------------------------------------------------
[00000210][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Amazing!
I want to eat panis and panis as well!
Eat your fill!
------------------------------------------------
[00000211][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Ah...but,
If you eat too much food,
Your sister will scold you...
------------------------------------------------
[00000212][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed, don't you understand?
Hmm...I don't really understand Panis either...
What kind of festival is it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000213][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I'm glad you're back in the village!
Freed, what do you want to do now?
------------------------------------------------
[00000214][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I want to live with Panis forever.
------------------------------------------------
[00000215][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah!
Panis, I'm with Freed!
After all, I can't leave!
------------------------------------------------
[00000216][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I want to explore the island.
------------------------------------------------
[00000217][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Is that so!
Well, let's go with Panis!
Let's fight together, Freed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000218][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Would you like to go off the island for a while?
------------------------------------------------
[00000219][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Why……?
Freed, do you dislike this island?
------------------------------------------------
[00000220][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis, I want to be here!
So Freed, don't go anywhere!
I have to disappear!
------------------------------------------------
[00000221][パニス,char_002 Panis]
...Freed, what's wrong?
Do you have so many things you want to do that you feel stuck?
------------------------------------------------
[00000222][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis... I want to eat bread!
I wonder if it will be a quick meal!
------------------------------------------------
[00000223][フリード,char_001 Fried]
The weather is nice today too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000224][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Let's do our best today too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000225][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed, hurry up!
------------------------------------------------
[00000226][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Let's do our best today too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000227][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Let's go home soon.
------------------------------------------------
[00000228][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I'm tired today.
------------------------------------------------
[00000229][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis, I'm tired.
------------------------------------------------
[00000230][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis, I'm sleepy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000231][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I'm already sleepy today.
Let's go to bed soon...
------------------------------------------------
[00000232][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I have to work hard tomorrow too,
I think I'll go to sleep today.
------------------------------------------------
[00000233][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis, like a dream of delicious bread.
Wow...
------------------------------------------------
[00000234][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I wonder if tomorrow will be a good day too...I wonder...
Wow...
------------------------------------------------
[00000235][ガルゼー,char_501]
Yes, Panis-chan, let me give you this.
Everyone must be depressed because the village is destroyed.
Please help me out.
------------------------------------------------
[00000236][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yay, all the stamp cards are filled.
Okay, let's bring it to the village chief quickly!
------------------------------------------------
[00000237][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hey! Yay!
------------------------------------------------
[00000238][ガルゼー,char_501]
Congratulations. Now let's do a giveaway.
------------------------------------------------
[00000239][ガルゼー,char_501]
I'll do my best next time.
Look, it's a new card.
------------------------------------------------
[00000240][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Look at that beautiful fountain.
------------------------------------------------
[00000241][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Wow! It feels great here!
------------------------------------------------
[00000242][パニス,char_002 Panis]
It's hot...
Panis, I want to take a bath!
------------------------------------------------
[00000243][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hey Panis! Don't jump into the fountain!
------------------------------------------------
[00000244][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hey, hey, I picked up some money.
------------------------------------------------
[00000245][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Wow!
------------------------------------------------
[00000246][アリーゼ,char_504]

[00000251][パニス,char_002 Panis]

...It's sweet and delicious!
------------------------------------------------

...Amazing! There are so many different things!
------------------------------------------------
[00000256][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hey hey Freed!
Panis, I want to eat bread!
------------------------------------------------
[00000257][フリード,char_001 Fried]
O.K. I understand.
Well, I'll bake it for you at home.
------------------------------------------------
[00000258][パニス,char_002 Panis]

------------------------------------------------
[00000259][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Ugh...bread looks delicious...

------------------------------------------------
[00000260][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I have no choice...
So, just one?
------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
[00000270][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hey hey, these squishes are fluffy!
------------------------------------------------
[00000271][フリード,char_001 Fried]
The sea is so beautiful. Makes me want to swim.
But I have to keep watch to make sure the pirates don't come...
------------------------------------------------
[00000272][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Pirate...
Will Bacchus come again?
------------------------------------------------
[00000273][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Wow! The sea is big!
------------------------------------------------
[00000274][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I wonder what it's like on the other side of the sea...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000275][パニス,char_002 Panis]
...Wow!
It's so hot here, Freed!
It's a big deal if you have a penis...
------------------------------------------------
[00000276][パニス,char_002 Panis]

------------------------------------------------
[00000277][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Eh... where?
It's true! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000278][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis, that fish is starting to look like bread...
Ugh...I'm hungry...
------------------------------------------------
[00000279][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Ah...there it was! The fish are coming to the shallows!
------------------------------------------------
[00000280][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Really!? Let's go fishing, Freed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000281][パニス,char_002 Panis]
that? Did it come from the sea?
------------------------------------------------
[00000282][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Hey, Freed! I'll share some of the fish with you!
Don't be shy! It was a big catch today!
Ga-ha-ha-ha!
------------------------------------------------
[00000283][パニス,char_002 Panis]
……that?

------------------------------------------------
[00000284][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Take a look!
There it was! Crab!
------------------------------------------------
[00000285][パニス,char_002 Panis]
……a! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000286][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Look! It's full of animals!
------------------------------------------------
[00000287][ブレンダ,char_519]
Look, look. Isn't this flower beautiful?
I'll give it to Panis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000288][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Wow! thank you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000289][パニス,char_002 Panis]
look look! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000290][パニス,char_002 Panis]
that……?
ah! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000291][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Wow...
This smell...the smell of the sun...
------------------------------------------------
[00000292][ドルトン,char_506]
Want to strengthen your cannon?
For that you need a magic brick.
Please look for me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000293][ドルトン,char_506]
If you bring me a magic brick,
Let's strengthen the cannon.
------------------------------------------------
[00000294][ドルトン,char_506]
Oh, Freed.
Did you bring a magic brick?
------------------------------------------------
[00000295][ドルトン,char_506]
Okay, now we can strengthen the cannon.
Look forward to it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000296][ドルトン,char_506]
I came up with a way to make the cannon even stronger.
If you want to increase the power of your cannon,
Bring me the fuse.
------------------------------------------------
[00000297][ドルトン,char_506]
When you bring the fuse,
I'll strengthen the cannon even more.
------------------------------------------------
[00000298][ドルトン,char_506]
what up?
Did you bring a fuse?
------------------------------------------------
[00000299][ドルトン,char_506]
This will further strengthen your cannon.
The battle will be advantageous.
------------------------------------------------
[00000300][ドルトン,char_506]
There is a way to best strengthen your cannon.
That requires a tough gun barrel.
Please look for me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000301][ドルトン,char_506]
As long as you have a rugged gun barrel,
You can make your cannon the strongest.
------------------------------------------------
[00000302][ドルトン,char_506]
Is that... perhaps a rugged gun barrel?
------------------------------------------------
[00000303][ドルトン,char_506]
Okay, now we can make the cannon the strongest.
Look forward to it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000304][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
If you bring me a sharp needle,
Let's make a fishing hook.
You'll be able to catch more fish.
------------------------------------------------
[00000305][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Did you find a sharp needle?
When you bring it, I'll make you a fishing hook.
------------------------------------------------
[00000306][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Oh, did you bring a sharp needle?
------------------------------------------------
[00000307][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Well then, let's make a fishing hook.
------------------------------------------------
[00000308][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
To get more fishing results
It's a good idea to make your fishing line out of conductive thread.
Once I find the materials, I'll make it for you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000309][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Have you found any conductive thread?
When you make a fishing line with it,
The fishing results are extraordinary.
------------------------------------------------
[00000310][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Isn't that a conductive thread?
------------------------------------------------
[00000311][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Let's make a fishing line right away.
This is sure to be a big catch.
------------------------------------------------
[00000312][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
To develop the farm
You need pine leaves.
Could you please help?
------------------------------------------------
[00000313][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
When the pine leaves gather,
You can expect an increase in yield.
thank you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000314][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Did you collect pine leaves for me?
------------------------------------------------
[00000315][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
thank you.
This will help the village's food production.
It can be made more stable.
------------------------------------------------
[00000316][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
How to improve your farm
Requires golem soil.
I would like to ask for your cooperation again.
------------------------------------------------
[00000317][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Once the golem soil is collected,
The food situation in the village will further improve.
thank you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000318][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Were you able to collect the golem soil?
------------------------------------------------
[00000319][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
thank you.
Now everyone in the village can eat well.
I think it will be a big improvement.
------------------------------------------------
[00000320][ピーター,char_520]
for the animals
I need the hair of a forest boar.
It would be helpful if you could help me find it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000321][ピーター,char_520]
How about the body hair of the Mori boar I asked for the other day?
Please do your best for the sake of the animals.
------------------------------------------------
[00000322][ピーター,char_520]
Did you bring the hair of the forest boar?
------------------------------------------------
[00000323][ピーター,char_520]
thank you.
Now your animals will grow up fast!
------------------------------------------------
[00000324][ピーター,char_520]
For the animals
Now I need some fancy red cloth.
Could you please find me some high-quality red cloth...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000325][ピーター,char_520]
How about some fancy red cloth?
I'm counting on you, Freed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000326][ピーター,char_520]
You found some high-quality red cloth for me, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000327][ピーター,char_520]
thanks so much!
I'm sure the animals will love it too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000328][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Oh, did you catch the fish I mentioned?
------------------------------------------------
[00000329][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
well done!
This is a reward, take it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000330][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Have you improved your fishing skills? Let's see how good you are!
Catch the fish I say!
------------------------------------------------
[00000331][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
What's wrong, you still can't catch fish?
------------------------------------------------
[00000332][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Well, it's only natural to catch this much.
Next is the real thing.
Come back in a while, Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000333][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Have you been fishing lately?
Alright, let's see how good you are!
Catch the fish I say!
------------------------------------------------
[00000334][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
What's the matter? It shouldn't be a difficult opponent, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000335][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Maybe it was a little too easy...
Next time, let's go for something a little more chewy!
Come back in a while. Surely?
------------------------------------------------
[00000336][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Are you improving your fishing skills?
Let's show you how much you've improved!
Catch the fish I say!
------------------------------------------------
[00000337][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
What's wrong, are you feeling unwell?
------------------------------------------------
[00000338][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It's natural to catch this fish too.
It will get more and more difficult from now on.
Come back in a while. Be prepared, okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000339][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Are you fishing well? Okay, let's see how good you are!
Catch the fish I say!
------------------------------------------------
[00000340][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
what up?
With your skills, you should be able to catch a fish right away, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000341][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It was quite a big thing.
Keep up the good work next time.
Well, come back in a while.
------------------------------------------------
[00000342][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Are you serious about fishing?
Okay! Show me how serious you are!
Catch the fish I say!
------------------------------------------------
[00000343][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Don't give up, okay?
It's not a fish you can't catch!
------------------------------------------------
[00000344][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
You'll do a great job too!
Good luck next time!
Well then. Come back in a while.
------------------------------------------------
[00000345][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Have you improved your fishing skills?
Ha ha ha, you say it!
Then try to catch the fish I say!
------------------------------------------------
[00000346][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
What's wrong, are you having a hard time?
Was it just your mouth that improved?
------------------------------------------------
[00000347][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
You weren't just talking after all!
Good, good!
Come back in a while! Keep raising your arms!
------------------------------------------------
[00000348][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Have you been sluggish lately?
Hey, let me inspire you!
Show me how you caught the fish I said!
------------------------------------------------
[00000349][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
What's wrong, is it really difficult this time?
------------------------------------------------
[00000350][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
well done!
It's time to escape the slump!
Come back in a while. I'll guide you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000351][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Did you get better at fishing again?
Hahahaha!　You started to shout loudly!
In that case, can you catch the fish I mentioned?
------------------------------------------------
[00000352][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
What happened, what happened?
Didn't he raise his arm?
------------------------------------------------
[00000353][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Your skill is also great!
If this is the case, I can look forward to the next one!
Come back in a while. I'll think about the problem.
------------------------------------------------
[00000354][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
You have also become quite an expert at fishing.
Let me try out your skills!
I'll catch the fish I said!
------------------------------------------------
[00000355][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
What's the matter? You should be able to catch fish with your skills, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000356][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Did you raise that by yourself...!
Well done! I'm close to becoming a fishing expert!
Come back in a while. Next is the final exam.
------------------------------------------------
[00000357][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It's finally time for the final fishing test...Are you ready?
If you clear this, you'll definitely be a fishing expert!
Look, you're going to catch the fish I'm talking about!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000358][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Is this fish difficult even for you?
But don't give up, okay?
The title of fishing expert is already in front of you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000359][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
You finally did it, Freed!　
There's no fish you can't catch anymore. He's a great fishing expert!
Keep working hard on fishing so you don't let your skills get dull!
------------------------------------------------
[00000360][リアン,char_514]
It smells so good!
Looks like you brought the bread I said.
------------------------------------------------
[00000361][リアン,char_514]
oh dear! Yes, I'll reward you with a new recipe.
------------------------------------------------
[00000362][リアン,char_514]
Freed, Pan's path is difficult.
I'll give you a taste,
Bake the bread as I tell you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000363][リアン,char_514]
Is the bread toasted?
I'll bring it to you when it's cooked.
------------------------------------------------
[00000364][リアン,char_514]
Yes, it's well-cooked!
But it's only natural to be able to do this much.
I still have a long way to go to master the path of bread.
------------------------------------------------
[00000365][リアン,char_514]
Freed wants to master the art of bread, right?
If so, don't slack off.
I'll taste it again, so go ahead and toast some bread.
------------------------------------------------
[00000366][リアン,char_514]
When the bread is baked, please bring it to me.
I'll be waiting.
------------------------------------------------
[00000367][リアン,char_514]
...Yeah, it tastes fine.
But don't skip baking bread, right?
Next time, I'll give you a more difficult problem.
------------------------------------------------
[00000368][リアン,char_514]
How has your bread baking level improved?
I'll give you a taste,
Please bake the bread as I say.
------------------------------------------------
[00000369][リアン,char_514]
how are you?
Bring me the bread when it's baked.
------------------------------------------------
[00000370][リアン,char_514]
Yeah, it's quite an accomplishment.
However, I think Freed will still be able to make good bread.
Please continue to bake bread.
------------------------------------------------
[00000371][リアン,char_514]
Freed, are you working hard on your bread career?
I'll give you a taste,
Bake the bread as I tell you. Good?
------------------------------------------------
[00000372][リアン,char_514]
Surely you haven't forgotten about bread, have you?
When it's cooked, bring it to me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000373][リアン,char_514]
Yeah, it's pretty good.
Freed seems to have gotten used to it quite a bit.
Keep up the good work and keep up the good work.
------------------------------------------------
[00000374][リアン,char_514]
The path of bread is profound, Freed.
I'll test if you're working hard every day.
Please bake the bread as I say.
------------------------------------------------
[00000375][リアン,char_514]
Are you baking bread properly?
Bring it to me when it's burnt.
------------------------------------------------
[00000376][リアン,char_514]
...Yes, I passed. It's deliciously grilled.
Next time I'll try a more difficult bread.
------------------------------------------------
[00000377][リアン,char_514]
...Okay, Freed?
Don't stop and move forward on the path of bread, okay?
Now, go ahead and toast some bread so I can taste it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000378][リアン,char_514]
You haven't forgotten how to make it, have you?
Bring me the bread when it's baked.
------------------------------------------------
[00000379][リアン,char_514]
...Oh, that's good!
You've improved a lot, Freed.
I'll taste it again, so try your best next time.
------------------------------------------------
[00000380][リアン,char_514]
Freed's bread baking techniques,
The level has risen considerably.
Now, go ahead and toast some bread so I can taste it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000381][リアン,char_514]
There's no need to panic.　
When the bread is baked to your satisfaction,
Bring it to me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000382][リアン,char_514]
Very well done!
It's so delicious!
Now, what should I do next...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000383][リアン,char_514]
I think it's time for me to show you how much I've improved.
Please bake me the bread I asked for.
...It's a little difficult this time, isn't it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000384][リアン,char_514]
...Freed, are you having a hard time?
But good luck! Master the art of bread!
------------------------------------------------
[00000385][リアン,char_514]
Yes, you did very well!
I think I've become quite skilled!
But let's aim even higher!
------------------------------------------------
[00000386][リアン,char_514]
Freed, the pinnacle of bread's path is right around the corner!
Come on, I'll give you a taste.
Bake bread as I say!
------------------------------------------------
[00000387][リアン,char_514]
If you've come this far, there's no need to worry.
Take your time with bread.
------------------------------------------------
[00000388][リアン,char_514]
Delicious... from your bread,
You can feel the kindness that they have for the people who eat them.
If you've come this far, you're just one step away from becoming a top-notch baker!
------------------------------------------------
[00000389][リアン,char_514]
Now, the final challenge, Freed!
Bake the bread as I say!
You can do it!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000390][リアン,char_514]
I'll face Pan with all my heart and all my strength, okay?
this is! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000391][リアン,char_514]
Well done, Freed!
There's no bread that can't be baked anymore!
You are a top baker! Congratulations!

Apparently I washed up on this island when I was small.
The village chief says that it was shining brightly at that time.
To be honest, I don't really remember.
------------------------------------------------
[00000527][パニス,char_002 Panis]
It's Panis!
They say everyone is an angel, but
Panis, I don't understand.

------------------------------------------------
[00000531][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
This figure is Seraphim.
A white guardian who protects this world with a bow of light and melodies.

Of course, they aren't related by blood.
I run a bakery on the outskirts of the village.

Switch your treasure from a fishing rod to a halberd and shield,
I'll protect my friends from the enemy!
