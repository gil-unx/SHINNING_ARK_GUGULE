[00000000][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
What, Freed?
What are you sneaking around on?
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I'm not sneaking around.
Because Levin is alone in a place like this,
He wanted to talk slowly.
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I'm sorry, but I don't feel like talking to you.
I'm looking at the island in a good mood.
Please don't disturb me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Well, without saying that, let's talk a little bit.
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I don't know what you're talking about, but just a little.
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What will Levin do now?
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I do not know.
When I was thinking about it, this is where my feet were headed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][フリード,char_001 Fried]
This place is peaceful and comfortable.
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
That's right. This is where you can feel the richness of this village the most.
By the way, maybe. It's my favorite place.
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I like it too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
If you are someone who has a strong feeling for the village...this island,
Everyone will love this place.
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][フリード,char_001 Fried]
After all, Levin cares about the village and the island,
I guess he thinks about it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
It's not necessarily the "feeling" you expect, is it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][フリード,char_001 Fried]
However, I am grateful for the fact that they care about the island.
It won't change, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
...Maybe.
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][フリード,char_001 Fried]
In that case, that's fine with me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
As always, you...
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I'll take a moment to confess.
I once sealed off his ambition to take over this island.
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][フリード,char_001 Fried]
eh?
That's nice, but are you serious?
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
After all this trouble
I imitated a fire thief and stole the island.
It's like being made fun of until the world really comes to an end.
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][フリード,char_001 Fried]
After all, you have to fight and win, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Well, that's right.
Even if this island were to become mine now,
That's not fun at all. I don't have enough sense of accomplishment.
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That idea doesn't sound like a pirate.
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
There are many different kinds of pirates.
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][フリード,char_001 Fried]
that's……
Is it unique to a former princely pirate?
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
ah.
I guess I'm a rare pirate after all.
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][フリード,char_001 Fried]
eh? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Don't be surprised if you hear it yourself!
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No...I admit it too easily.
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
That's right. Maybe it's a joke.
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][フリード,char_001 Fried]
eh?
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hahaha.
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What, was that a lie...
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Who said it was a lie?
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Is it true after all?
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Im kidding.
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Which one!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Do whatever you like.
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Already~!! Make it clear~!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hi Levin. What are you looking at?
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
It's not like I'm looking at anything special.
When I look at the village, I just look at it without saying anything.
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I see, this is Levin's
It's my favorite place.
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
It's nice to look at the sea, but
It's not bad to see green like this.
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree.
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Isn't it difficult to see the beautiful scenery with just one eye?
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Once you get used to it, it doesn't matter.
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Those eyes...what happened?
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I can't help it. It's just blocked.
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][フリード,char_001 Fried]
eh!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Can you see the eyes that are blocked?
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
of course.
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][フリード,char_001 Fried]
what.
All I knew was that it was destroyed during the battle...
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Do I look like such an idiot?
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But why do you go out of your way to cover one eye?
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
It's to help you see better at night.
When you suddenly go from a bright place to a dark place,
You won't be able to see anything until your eyes adjust, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
If I lose my life because of that, nothing will happen forever.
You won't be able to see it. So one eye is always on
I want it to work in the dark.
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is that so……
So a pirate with one eye closed?
Is everyone actually like that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
That's probably not the case.
But not only pirates, but also Katagi sailors.
It's not uncommon to see people with one eye covered.
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Levin wasn't originally a pirate either, right?
Was he a sailor before he became a pirate?
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
You can't help but
Don't try to bring it up to my old story...
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Because I'm curious.
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
My country was a maritime nation.
It's bigger than this island, but
The same goes for being surrounded by the sea on all sides.
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
That's why all the men go on the boat.
If he doesn't know about ships and the sea, he can't live a good life.
That's the kind of country it is.
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
As the second prince of that country,
He was in charge of the navy...
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Huh!? Then it's the prince after all...
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Well, what do you think?
Maybe everything just now is a lie?
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I'll say that again...
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hahaha. Stop worrying, stop worrying, boy.
Someday when I feel like it
Maybe you'll just tell me the truth?
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yes yes...
I'll wait without relying on it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hi Levin.
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Sorry boy, I'm still trying to figure it out.
See you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Levin, where are you going?
I’m curious…)
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][フリード,char_001 Fried]
There's no need...
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I happened to find a monster that was about to attack the village.
I am indebted to this village,
I wanted to kill it before it caused any damage.
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I can defeat a guy like that by myself.
That's why I came to defeat him alone.
...Is there any problem?
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Wouldn't it be safer if we all worked together?
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
It's not enough just to cooperate in everything.
That's what familiarity is all about.
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Working together to fight monsters,
We're not friends!
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Socialize in moderation.
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
It's my life lesson.
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...What you're saying is contradictory.
You are our strength,
You said it was a “unity,” right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Oh, I did say that.
But I'm outside of that circle.
I have no business or interest in uniting with you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000083][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's why...
------------------------------------------------
[00000084][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
This kind of relationship is just right.
That's what I mean when I say no to acquaintances.
------------------------------------------------
[00000085][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But I still can't accept it.
Even Levin's pirate friends...
------------------------------------------------
[00000086][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Did it look like you were familiar with each other?
I didn't have the slightest intention of doing so...
------------------------------------------------
[00000087][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Are you a friend who is always with you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000088][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Not always.
We'll stay together if we need to, and we'll separate if we don't need to.
In fact, we've already broken up.
------------------------------------------------
[00000089][フリード,char_001 Fried]
eh?
------------------------------------------------
[00000090][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
You can't move a ship alone.
That's why I paid them and hired them, but even in another world.
It's cruel to have to accompany her. So I set him free.
------------------------------------------------
[00000091][フリード,char_001 Fried]
So, what about everyone now...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000092][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I do not know. I'll probably be on another ship.
------------------------------------------------
[00000093][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is it so……
But everyone was always with Levin.
Don't you want to be there?
------------------------------------------------
[00000094][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
How about?
Everyone treats it as a job to the last,
I think he was just with me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000095][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But if we're together,
Isn't it a strong bond?
That's all we can do together.
------------------------------------------------
[00000096][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Yeah...maybe.
Indeed, that is your strength.
------------------------------------------------
[00000097][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
But that's a stranger's story.
------------------------------------------------
[00000098][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
...It's a little too heavy for me right now.
------------------------------------------------
[00000099][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Well, there are many things.
------------------------------------------------
[00000100][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Levin...
------------------------------------------------
[00000101][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000102][フリード,char_001 Fried]
You were here after all.
------------------------------------------------
[00000103][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
You look like you want to ask me something again.
------------------------------------------------
[00000104][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000105][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
……ah.
------------------------------------------------
[00000106][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I want to ask you again.
------------------------------------------------
[00000107][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
law. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000108][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Levin's past.
Where were you born and what kind of people did you meet?
What made you want to become a pirate?
------------------------------------------------
[00000109][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
What do you do when you hear it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000110][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I just don't understand Levin's way of thinking.
So, when I heard various things about Levin,
I thought I might be able to understand it a little bit.
------------------------------------------------
[00000111][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
You also like things.
------------------------------------------------
[00000112][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I want to know more about Levin.
------------------------------------------------
[00000113][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
It's a straight shot again.
------------------------------------------------
[00000114][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Well, that's fine. It's not something to hide.
Second Prince of Wilhelm Kingdom,
Let us tell you about the life of Levin Williams.
------------------------------------------------
[00000115][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Second prince...
------------------------------------------------
[00000116][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Our country is far away from here, across the ocean.
It is probably a large country that no one living on this island knows about.
I've been sailing on warships since I was a child.
------------------------------------------------
[00000117][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
From that time on, I was unbeatable in handling the bayonet,
After he grew up and was assigned the command ship and then the navy,
He defeated the countries that opposed him one after another.
------------------------------------------------
[00000118][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Pirates were successful and defeated without any questions asked.
It was fun back then...
------------------------------------------------
[00000119][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Why is that a pirate?
------------------------------------------------
[00000120][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
All sorts of gears started to go out of whack.
I think I had a lot of trust from my subordinates,
Apparently, my brother didn't like it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000121][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
I loved my brother
He respected him as the first prince.
Originally, I had no ambition to rule the country.
------------------------------------------------
[00000122][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Therefore, if you are loyal to your country and fulfill your duties,
I thought that I would eventually gain my brother's understanding.
I didn't really care.
------------------------------------------------
[00000123][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
However, other emotions began to swirl around me...
------------------------------------------------
[00000124][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Another emotion?
------------------------------------------------
[00000125][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
That's too much trust, Freed.
My men, the Navy guys, I'm
Don't tell me that you're more worthy of being king than my brother.
------------------------------------------------
[00000126][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Before I knew it, they lifted me up,
They began working to unseat his brother as heir to the throne.
------------------------------------------------
[00000127][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
By the time I realized it, it was already too late.
My brother and those who support him, and those who support me
There was an open conflict.
------------------------------------------------
[00000128][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Now it's time to decide between sexes with the sword.
There is no solution other than for either party to withdraw.
------------------------------------------------
[00000129][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
In the end, I voluntarily renounced my right to inheritance and left the country.
I swore to my brother that I would never come back.
------------------------------------------------
[00000130][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Since then, I have been thinking about the country that I should rule.
Or they roam the wide ocean in search of territory.
------------------------------------------------
[00000131][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh I see……
------------------------------------------------
[00000132][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
My subordinates are also thinking about me.
It was probably an action.
That's why it was so hard for me. It was sad.
------------------------------------------------
[00000133][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Since then, I have tried not to have deep relationships with people.
It's okay for me to include it. Moderation can be maintained.
------------------------------------------------
[00000134][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
However, other people think about it.
Hiring someone for money is the best you can do.
------------------------------------------------
[00000135][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Socialize in moderation. That's what it means.
------------------------------------------------
[00000136][フリード,char_001 Fried]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000137][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
what up? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000138][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No... how should I say it...
Somehow, from the usual Levin
I can't even imagine...
------------------------------------------------
[00000139][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Really?
------------------------------------------------
[00000140][フリード,char_001 Fried]
The way he speaks is also different than usual.
------------------------------------------------
[00000141][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
ah……
Whenever I talk about my country, I tend to go back to my old tone.
------------------------------------------------
[00000142][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But thank you for talking to me.
I can't say it clearly, but I think Levin's way of thinking is a little
I feel like I understand.
------------------------------------------------
[00000143][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Really. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000144][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (But... that way of thinking...
Does Levin really think he's right...? )
------------------------------------------------
[00000145][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hi Levin. What are you doing?
------------------------------------------------
[00000146][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
No, just a little bit with Sister.
------------------------------------------------
[00000147][フリード,char_001 Fried]
With Kilmaria?
That's an unusual combination.
------------------------------------------------
[00000148][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Thank you for waiting, Mr. Levin!
Are Mr. Freed and Mr. Panis also with you?
It's nice and reassuring to have 4 people!
------------------------------------------------
[00000149][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, we were just passing by...
------------------------------------------------
[00000150][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Let's go together!
Actually, I found something strange during my research.
I invited Mr. Levin.
------------------------------------------------
[00000151][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What's strange?
------------------------------------------------
[00000152][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
My sister said that there was a rock with my name carved on it.
Looks like you found it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000153][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
The guys from my pirate group...
They say it's a message they left behind...
------------------------------------------------
[00000154][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...!?
We're going too! Isn't it okay, Levin!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000155][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
ah……
------------------------------------------------
[00000156][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000157][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Levin?
------------------------------------------------
[00000158][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000159][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Let me read it for a moment.
What what……
------------------------------------------------
[00000160][]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000 Mr. Levin...I got angry every time I called him that.
I want you to forgive me just for today.
------------------------------------------------
[00000161][]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000As you said, I've always called myself "captain"
I was calling you, but in my heart, I was always
I used to call him "Mr. Levin."
------------------------------------------------
[00000162][]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000But I hope to board Mr. Levin's ship.
I was quite confused at first.
I underestimated the dangerous prince's pretending to be a pirate.
------------------------------------------------
[00000163][]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000Of course, once you get on the ship,
Those concerns quickly disappeared, though.
------------------------------------------------
[00000164][]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000Anyway, Mr. Levin,
He was the best sailor I've ever met.
I'm sure everyone felt the same way.
------------------------------------------------
[00000165][フリード,char_001 Fried]
This... was addressed to Levin...
------------------------------------------------
[00000166][]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000When Mr. Levin said he was disbanding due to lack of money,
Everything in front of me became pitch black.
Words I never wanted to hear...
------------------------------------------------
[00000167][]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000 All of us Levin Pirates, even if we don't have money
I was determined to follow Mr. Levin for the rest of my life.
------------------------------------------------
[00000168][]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000But I knew that, Mr. Levin.
He didn't want to involve us in leaving for another world.
It turns out he fired me on purpose.

@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000So we got fed up and decided to get off the ship.
I swore that I would never go against Master Levin,
I cannot interfere with Mr. Levin.
------------------------------------------------
[00000170][]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000Instead,
We started living on this island.
To protect the island until Master Levin returns.
------------------------------------------------
[00000171][]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000It was difficult at first to get used to living on land,
When I tried it, it was actually fun.
After all, it has continued for over 60 years.
------------------------------------------------
[00000172][]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000 All my friends died, and I, the last one left,
It looks like it's finally time to pick you up, but I have no regrets.
I'm satisfied that I've been able to live up to my vows.
------------------------------------------------
[00000173][]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000 In the name of the proud Levin Pirates,
I would like to report here that I have successfully protected this island.
I believe that Mr. Levin will definitely return to this island from another world.

It was a note from one of the sailors who left behind.
Levin...
------------------------------------------------
[00000175][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Shit...
------------------------------------------------
[00000176][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
He passed away leaving behind something like this...
------------------------------------------------
[00000177][フリード,char_001 Fried]
With everyone in the pirate group,
It wasn't just a relationship where I hired someone for money.
------------------------------------------------
[00000178][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
that's right! I think I was satisfied that I achieved justice.
------------------------------------------------
[00000179][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Satisfied... huh?
------------------------------------------------
[00000180][フリード,char_001 Fried]
The sailors were my ``comrades.''
But if Levin doesn't accept that feeling,
They don't get excited either.
------------------------------------------------
[00000181][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
fellow……
------------------------------------------------
[00000182][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Levin was protected by his "comrades".
As a member of this island, this time with us,
We have to protect the island.
------------------------------------------------
[00000183][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
……mother.
That's a ridiculous logic.
------------------------------------------------
[00000184][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
……understood.
You might be right, Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000185][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Thank you, Levin!
------------------------------------------------
[00000186][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Wonderful Justice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000187][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
But I don't want to get to know each other.
------------------------------------------------
