[00000000][フリード,char_001 Fried]
So, if you talk about it, you'll understand!
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][バッカス,char_527]
Noisy!
We finally got our hideout,
It's so easy to get robbed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][ケルビム,char_529]
That's right, Captain.
We must protect the hideout with all our might.
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
There's no point in saying anything, Freed.
If this happens, I have no choice but to force myself to listen.
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
oh yeah.
For a brat who doesn't know the difference,
I have to punish you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][ケルビム,char_529]
Shift to interception mode.
Eliminate intruders.
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][ケルビム,char_529]
The starting point for the dreams I built with my friends,
I won't give it to you guys...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I feel like...we're becoming the bad guys...
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][バッカス,char_527]
Huh, Deputy Chief...
Are you okay……?
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][ケルビム,char_529]
Don't worry. There is no irreparable damage.
but……
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][ケルビム,char_529]
Tactical system is down.
Checking and restarting will take some time.
Combat cannot continue.
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][バッカス,char_527]
Damn it!
I finally got my hideout...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][ケルビム,char_529]
I'm sorry, Captain.
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][フリード,char_001 Fried]
So please listen to me!
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I've finally arrived.
Here is the secret of "power"...
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Velvet-san, wait!
It's dangerous if you don't look around carefully when walking.
There are monsters too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I understand, that's about it.
...You guys are already bothering me!
Get out of there!
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Now there will be no hindrances.
Let's start investigating!
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Velvet, calm down!
If you go that fast, you'll fall!
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...It looks like the number of Killmaria-san has increased by one.
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
You may find an example here.
Let's start investigating!
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Kilmaria, calm down.
We have to do something about the monsters first.
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
that's right.
What I did was
I just ran away.
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...I guess it's always the case.
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Now, let's exorcise the evil monster.
In the name of Justice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Dirty monster, go away!
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Good grief.
Looks like the monster was chased away.
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Mr. Kilmaria,
Now you can investigate to your heart's content.
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
thank you.
Let's start investigating!
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
As expected, the environment here is harsh.
I haven't stopped sweating since a while ago.
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Moreover, the monsters are also powerful.
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][フリード,char_001 Fried]
This seems a little tough.
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
But if we don't clean up, we can't investigate.
Let's do it, Freed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Looks like that's the end of the monster.
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Okay, let's investigate the ruins.
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
This is from the village...
Well, it's the ruins closest to the Ark.
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Since it's this close, I'm sure
There should also be some notes about the ark left.
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree.
But before we investigate, let's get rid of the monsters!
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Looks like the current monster is the last one.
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's right.
Now I can start investigating.
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Well, as the cutie expected,
Do you have any notes regarding the “Ark”?
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Burnt ruins...
Was I also responsible for this tragedy?
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hey, Adam, leave your worries behind.
Now is not the time to worry.
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][フリード,char_001 Fried]
that's right.
If you want to investigate the ruins, first look for monsters.
I have to chase them away.
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Understood, Mr. Freed.
Eliminate monsters wandering around the ruins.
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Within the detectable range,
It seems like there are no more monsters.
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Understood.
Well then, let's investigate.
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
yes.
So let's start investigating.
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
……I see.
Anyone can come if they want to.
If only I had the means to do so.
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][フリード,char_001 Fried]
There are many ancient weapons...
Where did it come from?
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Perhaps the individual that restarted when the ark departed,
It was probably still there.
It's surprising that I've come this far.
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Anyway, I have to do something about them!
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Whew.
Ancient weapons are tough after all.
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
There are no more hindrances,
Look for example notes.
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
...The person who wrote that...
I wonder what he was thinking when he came to this point.
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
This is the last ruin that hasn't been reexamined.
The boy's abilities and clues about "that",
I hope I can find it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][フリード,char_001 Fried]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Don't look so worried.
The air is getting sour.
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
First, let's take care of what needs to be done.
monsters roaming around
The first thing to do is to knock it out.
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Ah, that's right.
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Okay, the monsters are gone!
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
You look nice now, boy.
You have to be like that!
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Now, let's investigate the ruins.
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's Thor...
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It looks brutal.
I understand exactly what Adam means when he says "fuck you."
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Performance as a weapon,
It's more ferocious than it looks.
Everyone, please do not let your guard down.
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
I can't let him out.
I have to make up my mind here.
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, I know.
If I don't defeat him here, the island...
No, the world is in danger.
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Everyone, let's go!
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Did you defeat it...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
We did it, everyone!
We finally did it!
This is Justice's big victory!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I did it...I did it!
I was able to protect the world!
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
You're a big deal after all, boy!
Now, let's go home and celebrate!
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][パニス,char_002 Panis]
...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Panis, what's wrong?
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Sister, look.
There's something written here.
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What is it?
Where is it written?
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Look, it's here.
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
I'm sure this is the last thing I'll write down.
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
We can't read it.
Adam, please.
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I got it.
I'll read it out loud.
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
