[00000000][ガルゼー,char_501]
It looks like there's been a lot of damage around the plaza.
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][フリード,char_001 Fried]
This is exactly where the giant went on a rampage.
Thanks to Panis for driving me away
No one was injured, though.
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah!
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][ガルゼー,char_501]
Ah, I see I see. Panis-chan is a good girl.
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Ehehe...
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Village chief...
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][ガルゼー,char_501]
Kohon! However, the damage to the building
You should check how much.
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][ガルゼー,char_501]
Even on the outskirts of the village, the gust of wind caused by the giant
I've received word that there seems to be some damage.
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree. I'll go around the village and see what's going on.
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][ガルゼー,char_501]
Also, I want to know how everyone is doing.
I'm sure you're upset about today and yesterday.
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][ガルゼー,char_501]
Hear from everyone in the village and if you have any trouble,
Please help me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Understood.
That's Panis. Shall we go together?
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah!See you soon, Soncho!
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][ガルゼー,char_501]
ah. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Shannon, what's wrong? With a serious face.
Also, Dr. Maia and Peter.
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
We were just talking about school.
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][マイア,char_503]
Is that so. The school building is quite damaged...
I don't think I'll be able to use it for a while.
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][ピーター,char_520]
Not just the school building, but also around the plaza.
Looks like there's a lot of damage.
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][マイア,char_503]
Unfortunately, school will be closed for a while.
The school building has been repaired so that children can attend school safely.
Until then.
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][パニス,char_002 Panis]
school? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Really. No, you don't remember?
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hmm, I don't know.
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][マイア,char_503]
School is a gathering of children,
It's a place where we all study and play together.
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Everyone!? I want to go!
Panis, I want to go to school!
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's still not possible, Panis. We have to fix the school first.
Professor Maia, is there anything I can help you with?
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][マイア,char_503]
oh yeah. Everyone in the village will fix the school building.
It's supposed to be...
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][マイア,char_503]
Yesterday, the children were completely exhausted.
I'm scared.
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][マイア,char_503]
So, treat yourself to some warm bread.
I just want to cheer you up...
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's nice.
If it's bread, leave it to me and Shannon!
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Well, that's not how it works.
You need milk to bake bread, right?
However……
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Did something happen?
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][ピーター,char_520]
Due to yesterday's commotion, the animals kept at the farm were
Everyone ran away...
You see, it's because of the storm caused by the giant.
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I see, so that means you can't get milk?
Understood! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's good.
Well then, give a shout out to Zynga,
Shall we go now?
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][ピーター,char_520]
Is it okay?
It would be helpful if you could do that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah. Because I want to feed you warm bread.
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][マイア,char_503]
Freed-kun, Shannon-chan. thank you.
Well then, please?
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][ピーター,char_520]
thank you. Yes, this is milk for baking bread.
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Now you can bake bread! Actually, just a while ago,
I came up with a new recipe that looks really cool.
I'm sure the kids will love it too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][リアン,char_514]
picture!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
what? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][ピーター,char_520]
you know. I have work to do on the farm, so I'll go home now!
Goodbye!
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Peter is back...
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What is it? that person……
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Well, when I heard about Shannon's new work,
Anyone would want to run away...
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Did you say something!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No!Sister, you're more tired than that, aren't you?
I'll bake the bread.
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
picture? All right. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, no, uh...
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][リアン,char_514]
Um...Shannon?　
It's a good opportunity, so ask Freed this time.
I need to give Freed some bread baking experience.
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Oh, I see. That's true too.
Well then, Freed, do your best.
I'll stand by your side and watch you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][パニス,char_002 Panis]
fight! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Good...
When I tried my sister's new recipe,
I'm sure the kids will start crying...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (If you bake it normally without thinking about it,
Even though my sister's bread is delicious...
Why would you want to do something unnecessary?)
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Freed? What are you absent-minded about?
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture? It's nothing.
Instead of that, let's start baking bread as soon as possible.
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
yes? Are you ready?
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Yeah!You raised your arms, Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Wow!
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][フリード,char_001 Fried]
really?
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Are you going to keep up this momentum next time?
Well then, let's go deliver bread to the children!
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
here we go!Eat a lot and do your best starting tomorrow!
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][ロラン,char_507]
Oh! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][メリー,char_509]
Looks delicious!
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][フリード,char_001 Fried]
There's a lot of bread.
Don't rush, eat slowly.
Because it gets stuck in your throat.
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][パニス,char_002 Panis]
looks delicious……
Hey hey, sister!
Can I have panis too?
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Of course it's fine. But with other children
Don't fight over anything, okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah!Panis, this is good!
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][カール,char_508]
Hey, your sister's name is "Tenshi", right?
Tenshimo, do you eat bread?
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][パニス,char_002 Panis]
picture? Besides, I'm not even a big sister.
Panis is panis, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Also, Panis, I love bread!
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][メリー,char_509]
Hehe, I like bread too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Is that so? Ahahahaha!
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][マイア,char_503]
thank you. The children seem to have calmed down a lot.
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][マイア,char_503]
School will be closed, and family members will also
I'm too busy to have a partner,
It seemed like the kids were worried too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's okay, Professor Maia.
If this is all you need, I'll always help you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Oh yeah, if you need anything, let me know!
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][マイア,char_503]
Hehe, thank you.
Ah, that's right. Speaking of helping...
The village chief was looking for Freed-kun just now.
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][マイア,char_503]
It seems like there's something I need to do urgently.
I think it's better to go while it's still light.
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Understood. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000083][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Soncho! Hello! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000084][ガルゼー,char_501]
Oh, Panis-chan?
Looks like you brought Freed with you. That's great.
------------------------------------------------
[00000085][パニス,char_002 Panis]
that? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000086][ハイラム,char_513]
that's right. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000087][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is that so? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000088][ガルゼー,char_501]
Freed, do you know the way to the ruins?
That road is blocked by a fallen tree.
I would like to be able to pass somehow...
------------------------------------------------
[00000089][ハイラム,char_513]
The problem is that the fallen tree is a little too big.
Build a tower to lift it up,
Prepare logs to roll and carry out ......
------------------------------------------------
[00000090][ハイラム,char_513]
Anyway, to move the fallen tree
We need a big setup.
------------------------------------------------
[00000091][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I see. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000092][ハイラム,char_513]
Well. However, in order to set up a mechanism
We need lumber, but the village doesn't have much stock.
------------------------------------------------
[00000093][ハイラム,char_513]
So I went to the forest of giant trees,
I want to cut out some wood.
There are a lot of monsters over there...
------------------------------------------------
[00000094][ハイラム,char_513]
So while we were cutting down the wood,
I want to ask you guys to protect me. Mind you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000095][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Understood. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000096][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
A forest of giant trees...
------------------------------------------------
[00000097][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What's wrong, Shannon?
------------------------------------------------
[00000098][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Freed uses strange powers,
He remembered that he helped me.
That was also a forest of giant trees, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000099][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, is that it? At that moment I thought I was going to die.
It was just me and Shannon, and I was small.
There are a lot of monsters...
------------------------------------------------
[00000100][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's right.
I was also thinking that I could let Freed escape...
In the end, Freed defeated them all.
------------------------------------------------
[00000101][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It's strange even remembering it now...
It looks as if there are many Freeds...
------------------------------------------------
[00000102][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I don't really remember...
But then. There's some kind of power that I don't really understand
Now I can use it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000103][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I've been there since then too.
As an older sister, I felt like I needed to be stronger.
Also, Freed is surprisingly reliable...
------------------------------------------------
[00000104][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Sister?
------------------------------------------------
[00000105][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Nah, it's nothing!
Come on, come on! Let's head to the forest!
------------------------------------------------
[00000106][ハイラム,char_513]
Well, we've finally finished cleaning up the fallen tree.
I'm exhausted from doing heavy lifting for the first time in a while.
------------------------------------------------
[00000107][ハイラム,char_513]
Village chief, the road to the ruins is now passable.
I also took a look at some of the ruins,
There appears to be no particular damage.
------------------------------------------------
[00000108][ガルゼー,char_501]
Really. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000109][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Thank you for your hard work, Dad.
------------------------------------------------
[00000110][ハイラム,char_513]
Oh, and Shannon and Freed too.
Well then, I'll go home first.
------------------------------------------------
[00000111][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000112][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hey, Soncho?
What's at the end of that road?
------------------------------------------------
[00000113][ガルゼー,char_501]
At the end of that road are ruins...
In other words, buildings and stone monuments built by people in the past,
That's what remains.
------------------------------------------------
[00000114][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Sekihi?
------------------------------------------------
[00000115][ガルゼー,char_501]
Hmm. It is a large stone with letters and pictures carved into it.
Yes, you should go and see it once.
------------------------------------------------
[00000116][ガルゼー,char_501]
Among the stone monuments left at that ruins,
Apparently there are some that depict legends of angels.
------------------------------------------------
[00000117][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
But that stone monument has ancient language written on it, right?
Village chief, can you read ancient languages?
------------------------------------------------
[00000118][ガルゼー,char_501]
No, unfortunately it's not possible.
That's just what I'm hearing.
------------------------------------------------
[00000119][ガルゼー,char_501]
Besides, even if you can't read the stone monument,
I think the stone guardian deity is worth seeing.
That is wonderful.
------------------------------------------------
[00000120][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Ah, the stone statue in front of the shrine.
I want to show that to Panis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000121][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah!
------------------------------------------------
[00000122][ガルゼー,char_501]
Well then, please take me there once.
However, the road is still rough, so
Go and come back when it's daylight.
------------------------------------------------
[00000123][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Understood. I'll take you there next time.
------------------------------------------------
[00000124][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000125][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hey, the stone statue moved!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000126][パニス,char_002 Panis]
great! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000127][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It's not moving! No, it's working now!
It actually doesn't move!
It's dangerous anyway, so don't go there!
------------------------------------------------
[00000128][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Wow!
------------------------------------------------
[00000129][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I'm staring at Freed...
------------------------------------------------
[00000130][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Oh my god...
After I got home, I told my father and mother
What should I tell you...
------------------------------------------------
[00000131][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Isn't that based on the assumption that I'm going to die?
------------------------------------------------
[00000132][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hey!
------------------------------------------------
[00000133][？？？,char_601]

My name is Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000142][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Understood, Mr. Freed.
I will register you as my master.
Please link your personal information terminal if you wish.
------------------------------------------------
[00000143][フリード,char_001 Fried]

I got it.
Skip master information registration and complete the process.
Please give me your orders.
------------------------------------------------
[00000145][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What, what is that? What I say,
Does that mean you'll listen?
------------------------------------------------
[00000146][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I am made like that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000147][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
what is that! Does that mean you can give commands to the village's guardian deity?
Freed, give me some command!
------------------------------------------------
[00000148][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But even if you suddenly say something like that...
------------------------------------------------
[00000149][？？？,char_601]
Too! Moimoi!
------------------------------------------------
[00000150][フリード,char_001 Fried]

------------------------------------------------
[00000152][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Oh!
------------------------------------------------
[00000153][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Isn't this child a spirit?
Why are you here?
------------------------------------------------
[00000154][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Details are unknown, but
Apparently, they made the area around me their home.
It is guessed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000155][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
As I started,
Perhaps they were forced to change their habitat.
------------------------------------------------
[00000156][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's right……
That's kind of cute.
------------------------------------------------
[00000157][？？？,char_601]
Moi! Momomomoi!
------------------------------------------------
[00000158][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Ahaha! It's here!
Okay, okay, do you want to play?
------------------------------------------------
[00000159][？？？,char_601]
Yes!
------------------------------------------------
[00000160][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Wow... so cute...
Hey, can you come over here too?
------------------------------------------------
[00000161][？？？,char_601]
Too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000162][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Fufufu, here it comes!
Okay, let's play with your sister.
------------------------------------------------
[00000163][フリード,char_001 Fried]
huh……
It seems like they're both obsessed with that spirit.
------------------------------------------------
[00000164][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Mr. Freed? Do you have any orders?
------------------------------------------------
[00000165][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Ah, I see. Well, that's right...
For now, could you please come to the village with us?
------------------------------------------------
[00000166][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I got it. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000167][メリー,char_509]
Wow! It's a spirit! It's a spirit!
So cute!
------------------------------------------------
[00000168][？？？,char_601]
It’s so good!
------------------------------------------------
[00000169][カール,char_508]
Wow! It's huge!
This is how a guardian deity moves!
------------------------------------------------
[00000170][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Hello. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000171][ロラン,char_507]
Oh! cool!
------------------------------------------------
[00000172][マイア,char_503]
Moving the stone statue...
Panis-chan is a truly mysterious child...
------------------------------------------------
[00000173][メリー,char_509]
Because sensei! Panis is a must!
------------------------------------------------
[00000174][アリーゼ,char_504]
That's right~Move the guardian deity~
You brought such a cute spirit with you...
Panis may really be an angel!
------------------------------------------------
[00000175][アリーゼ,char_504]
Hey? Panis~?
Did you give this child a name?
------------------------------------------------
[00000176][パニス,char_002 Panis]
name? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000177][？？？,char_601]
Moi! Moimoi!

[00000179][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Sister, do you understand?
------------------------------------------------
[00000180][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Yeah. Spirit-san, is there something you want to tell everyone?
------------------------------------------------
[00000181][？？？,char_601]
It’s so good!　Moi~!
------------------------------------------------
[00000182][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
picture? What name?
------------------------------------------------
[00000183][？？？,char_601]
Moi moi moi!
------------------------------------------------
[00000184][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...Haganinmaru?
That's a pretty tough name...
------------------------------------------------
[00000185][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Korinmaru...
Wow wow! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000186][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Yes!
------------------------------------------------
[00000187][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hagane Maru!　Thank you for your continued support!
------------------------------------------------
[00000188][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Moimoi!
------------------------------------------------
[00000189][カール,char_508]
Hey Hey! Can you hear what this guy has to say?
------------------------------------------------
[00000190][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
yes.
Mr. Freed is my master.
------------------------------------------------
[00000191][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I see, that's a big deal.
To think that the village's guardian deity would follow him.
------------------------------------------------
[00000192][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, I don't know why,
Maybe it's just a coincidence!
------------------------------------------------
[00000193][マイア,char_503]
It's amazing that it happened by chance.
That's not something to be humble about.
------------------------------------------------
[00000194][ハイラム,char_513]
oh yeah! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000195][ジム,char_502]
What is that, Freed?
That guy was always making fun of me...
------------------------------------------------
[00000196][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
However, if it's this big, it must be powerful.
It looks like the village's recovery is going well.
------------------------------------------------
[00000197][ガルゼー,char_501]
That's right. Me too now
I just went looking around the village,
There are still many places that have not been repaired.
------------------------------------------------
[00000198][ガルゼー,char_501]
At the same time as we join together,
Was this...Adam?
Why not borrow his power?
------------------------------------------------
[00000199][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I see, that's true too.
Adam, can you give me a hand?
------------------------------------------------
[00000200][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
With Mr. Freed's permission.
------------------------------------------------
[00000201][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Of course.
Adam, help everyone.
------------------------------------------------
[00000202][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I got it. I will respond based on my own judgment.
So, where do we start?
------------------------------------------------
[00000203][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Erm, that's right...
------------------------------------------------
[00000204][ハイラム,char_513]
Well then, would you like to help me out on the farm?
Because of the storm caused by the giant,
It's gotten pretty rough.
------------------------------------------------
[00000205][ハイラム,char_513]
There are fallen trees and flying rocks all over the place.
You can do something about it, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000206][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I got it. Can be controlled remotely.
------------------------------------------------
[00000207][ハイラム,char_513]
picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000208][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
If the device complies with the standard,
It can be operated remotely.
Automatically searching for the location of the device.
------------------------------------------------
[00000209][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
...I couldn't find it.
Please configure the device manually.
------------------------------------------------
[00000210][ハイラム,char_513]
Well, I don't really understand.
Are you looking for tools?
If you need a spade or a hoe, you can find them in the warehouse over there.
------------------------------------------------
[00000211][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I got it.
There's no automatic equipment, right?
Do the work manually.
------------------------------------------------
[00000212][ハイラム,char_513]
Ah, that's it please.
I'd like to go to the field right away, but...
First I had to collect seeds.
------------------------------------------------
[00000213][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I understand about collecting seeds.
Please specify the location and type of crop to be harvested.
------------------------------------------------
[00000214][フリード,char_001 Fried]
If so, we will guide you.
Let's go, Adam.
------------------------------------------------
[00000215][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
The work is finished.
Sowing and watering have been completed. Check.
------------------------------------------------
[00000216][ハイラム,char_513]
Sigh...
------------------------------------------------
[00000217][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
law. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000218][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Isn't it a nice field?
I'll do it, Adam.
------------------------------------------------
[00000219][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
thank you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000220][ハイラム,char_513]
While working, I never get bored or feel tired.
He just keeps on wielding his hoe in silence.
This is the first time I've seen such a hard worker.
------------------------------------------------
[00000221][リアン,char_514]
It's true. Dad can't do this.
------------------------------------------------
[00000222][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Because I am a machine.
------------------------------------------------
[00000223][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I don't know, but it's just amazing, Adam.
good job!
------------------------------------------------
[00000224][パニス,char_002 Panis]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000225][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Panis? what happened?
------------------------------------------------
[00000226][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis...
I want to sing!
------------------------------------------------
[00000227][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000228][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah!
------------------------------------------------
[00000229][リアン,char_514]
That's a beautiful voice...
------------------------------------------------
[00000230][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
TRUE……
Somehow I feel calmer...
------------------------------------------------
[00000231][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Yes...
------------------------------------------------
[00000232][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000233][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
what up? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000234][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
No, it's nothing.
However, there is a slight change in the thought program...
------------------------------------------------
[00000235][ハイラム,char_513]
Hey! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000236][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture? a! Already sprouting!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000237][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Liar!? What do you mean?
------------------------------------------------
[00000238][リアン,char_514]
I wonder if it's because of Panis-chan's singing...
------------------------------------------------
[00000239][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Come to think of it, the giants were also chased away with songs.
What a mysterious power...
------------------------------------------------
[00000240][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Phew...
It's over!
------------------------------------------------
[00000241][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
This is...a song.
Panis-san's...song.
------------------------------------------------
[00000242][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hehehe, that's it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000243][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000244][パニス,char_002 Panis]
what happened? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000245][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
no. There is a slight change in the program...
------------------------------------------------
[00000246][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
However, I quickly recovered.
There seems to be no problem.
However, until now such malfunctions...
------------------------------------------------
[00000247][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Well, the details are fine!
Adam, continue like this from tomorrow.
Let's do our best!
------------------------------------------------
[00000248][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Yes, yes. I got it.
We will continue to assist with the restoration work.
------------------------------------------------
[00000249][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yes, please help me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000250][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Zynga, how is the fishing ground?
...Is that Adam? What did you come here for?
------------------------------------------------
[00000251][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I heard that Mr. Zinga called me.
Is there anything you need?
------------------------------------------------
[00000252][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
ah. I would be grateful if the people at the fishing grounds could also help out.
Do you mind?
------------------------------------------------
[00000253][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Even in response to Mr. Freed and Mr. Zynga's request,
is this good?
------------------------------------------------
[00000254][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, of course.
If only Adam wasn't overworked and tired.
------------------------------------------------
[00000255][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
No, I'm like you all.
You won't get tired.
Although there may be a temporary lack of energy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000256][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What are you talking about?
I don't really understand it, but
It's amazing that I don't get tired.
------------------------------------------------
[00000257][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
……nothing?
------------------------------------------------
[00000258][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Wow!
------------------------------------------------
[00000259][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
what? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000260][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Alert, alert.
Spotting an approaching ship.
A ship is approaching this point.
------------------------------------------------
[00000261][フリード,char_001 Fried]
A ship? Zynga, can you see it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000262][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Oh, I wonder. Even though it's so far away,
Good find, Adam.
------------------------------------------------
[00000263][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I have a defensive mid-range scanning system.
It is installed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000264][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I don't really understand that system, but
Well done Adam. Apparently the other party is a pirate ship.
------------------------------------------------
[00000265][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
pirate ship? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000266][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
No, that's Levin's ship.
This one is a little tough.
------------------------------------------------
[00000267][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Is Levin a former aristocrat or a prince?
He's the one that's rumored, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000268][フリード,char_001 Fried]
If so, it's a bit troublesome...
He has a completely different way of fighting than other pirates.
If you play against them normally, you won't be able to win.
------------------------------------------------
[00000269][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
We're getting pretty close to the beach.
I don't have time to chat!
Hurry up and prepare to attack!
------------------------------------------------
[00000270][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Levin!
------------------------------------------------
[00000271][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hey there, boy!　Your friends are with you too.
Have you been doing well?
------------------------------------------------
[00000272][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
There's no reason for you to ask me such a thing!
------------------------------------------------
[00000273][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Oh my, it's still the elf sister.
frightening. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000274][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000275][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
For a young and beautiful woman like you,
A more calm and graceful attitude is more suitable.
That's what I think, lady.
------------------------------------------------
[00000276][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
eh? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000277][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
He's still a nasty guy...
------------------------------------------------
[00000278][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
But, there's something elegant about it.
Maybe the rumors about the former prince are true...
------------------------------------------------
[00000279][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Levin, stop it!
Don't make fun of my sister by saying things you don't mean!
------------------------------------------------
[00000280][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
yeah?
------------------------------------------------
[00000281][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Freed! What's that?
Does that mean you think I'm no good?
Does that mean you think I’m ugly!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000282][フリード,char_001 Fried]
eh!?
No, no, that's not it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000283][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
...Hehe.
Hahahaha! Hahahaha!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000284][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
You guys are the same!
Thanks to this, you won't get bored no matter when you come!
I'm starting to want this island even more!
------------------------------------------------
[00000285][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
A location with abundant fruit and wide open access to the ocean.
And happy citizens. No matter what,
This person deserves to be my fief.
------------------------------------------------
[00000286][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Unfortunately. No one can take over the island.
Let me go home!
------------------------------------------------
[00000287][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
That line is the same as always. All right.
Territory is interesting because it can be taken by force.
------------------------------------------------
[00000288][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Well then, let's get started!
A battle to steal the country!
------------------------------------------------
[00000289][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Repairs have been completed.
Fishing boats can enter and exit.
------------------------------------------------
[00000290][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Oh! That means I can finally go fishing!
Hahaha! I've been waiting for this moment!
------------------------------------------------
[00000291][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Most of the equipment has regained its previous functionality.
It seems.
------------------------------------------------
[00000292][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
If the equipment is returned, it's ours!
Wait, fish!
This Jinga-sama is going to catch it soon!
------------------------------------------------
[00000293][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Hahahahahaha!
------------------------------------------------
[00000294][パニス,char_002 Panis]
……that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000295][フリード,char_001 Fried]
what happened? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000296][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Zynga is strange.
------------------------------------------------
[00000297][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Moimoi~?
------------------------------------------------
[00000298][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
ah. Zynga's main job is as a fisherman, right?
I love the sea and fish so much...
------------------------------------------------
[00000299][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Before I go fishing, I feel a bit uneasy.
It seems like I'm being too proud.
------------------------------------------------
[00000300][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Huh...
------------------------------------------------
[00000301][フリード,char_001 Fried]
There are some things that are a little different, but
Jinga is the best fisherman on the island.
------------------------------------------------
[00000302][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis, delicious fish coming soon.
You'll be able to eat a lot.
------------------------------------------------
[00000303][パニス,char_002 Panis]
fish? I want to eat it soon!
------------------------------------------------
[00000304][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hehehe. Wait, Panis.
When the jinga fishing begins,
I'll bake you some new bread filled with fish.
------------------------------------------------
[00000305][フリード,char_001 Fried]
stop! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000306][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What a reaction! It'll be okay this time!
------------------------------------------------
[00000307][ラナ,char_528]
Ahaha. It's still lively, isn't it?
You sisters and brothers.
------------------------------------------------
[00000308][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh, Lana!
------------------------------------------------
[00000309][ラナ,char_528]
Yes. Hello~♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000310][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hello Lana! But when did you come?
I never noticed your ship.
------------------------------------------------
[00000311][ラナ,char_528]
I felt like I was trying to figure something out,
We entered the port from the back side of the island.
It would be a problem if the ship was damaged.
------------------------------------------------
[00000312][ラナ,char_528]
It seems like he did a pretty good job, but
Is your opponent Levin?
------------------------------------------------
[00000313][フリード,char_001 Fried]
that's right.
He also said that he would make the island his territory.
------------------------------------------------
[00000314][ラナ,char_528]
Hmm, I don't regret it.
It's hard for you guys too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000315][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hey hey, who is this older sister?
------------------------------------------------
[00000316][ラナ,char_528]
I? We are conducting trade between the continent and this island.
Are you the rumored angel?
------------------------------------------------
[00000317][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Do you know about Panis?
------------------------------------------------
[00000318][ラナ,char_528]
Yeah. I've heard a lot of things from people in the village.
It must have been difficult, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000319][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Well. There were no injuries
It's a blessing in disguise.
------------------------------------------------
[00000320][ラナ,char_528]
It seems so. But broken buildings,
Isn't it difficult to repair? Even daily necessities
There will be things that I will have to buy again.
------------------------------------------------
[00000321][ラナ,char_528]
I'm visiting you today,
I brought some items that I thought I would need.
------------------------------------------------
[00000322][ラナ,char_528]
Well, things like lumber, nails, and building materials.
Medicine, blankets, and emergency food...
Also, give the children notes...
------------------------------------------------
[00000323][ラナ,char_528]
I wonder if it was something like that...?
Well, there are a lot of them, so feel free to use them if you like!
------------------------------------------------
[00000324][フリード,char_001 Fried]
thank you! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000325][ラナ,char_528]
It's good, it's good. We have to take care of our customers.
Well then, I'll head back to the ship!
------------------------------------------------
[00000326][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Yeah!
------------------------------------------------
[00000327][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Thanks to Lana, the village was restored.
Looks like it's going well...
I have to try harder! )
------------------------------------------------
[00000328][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Freed! everyone!
Hurry, the pirates have appeared again!
------------------------------------------------
[00000329][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Pirate? Are you coming by boat?
------------------------------------------------
[00000330][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Levin again? Even though I just arrived the other day.
------------------------------------------------
[00000331][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
No, not Levin or Bacchus.
It's new! Anyway, let's go to the beach over there!
------------------------------------------------
[00000332][？？？,char_601]
Oh, you're late, aren't you?
I've been waiting.
------------------------------------------------
[00000333][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I was waiting, you know?
------------------------------------------------
[00000334][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Yeah. I'm Velvet. He's a somewhat well-known pirate.
I look forward to working with you in the future.
------------------------------------------------
[00000335][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That Velvet-san and others,
What do you want to ask us? In this village,
I don't think I have the kind of information you want?
------------------------------------------------
[00000336][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That's not necessarily the case, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000337][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
If so, please tell me what you want to hear.
In some cases, we may not cooperate.
------------------------------------------------
[00000338][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000339][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Wait a minute!? Freed? Zynga?
What, isn't that too easy on pirates?
------------------------------------------------
[00000340][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Pirates or whatever,
As long as it doesn't cause any trouble to the village,
It would be better to let things go peacefully.
------------------------------------------------
[00000341][フリード,char_001 Fried]
So let's listen to the story first.
I mean, it's always like that, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000342][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
No, no, that's true, but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000343][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hehe, boys are good at listening.
Sister, you love those kind of kids, don't you?
Well then, I'll ask you again...
------------------------------------------------
[00000344][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What brings "power" to this island
It should be there...
i don't know?
------------------------------------------------
[00000345][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
"Power"...?
Even if you say so.
------------------------------------------------
[00000346][フリード,char_001 Fried]
There are people who ask me sometimes,
Even if we ask you
I don't know...
------------------------------------------------
[00000347][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Also in my database
Not recorded.
------------------------------------------------
[00000348][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
yes? Strange things still happen on this island
It seems like a lot of things are happening, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000349][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
The appearance of a legendary angel...
An attack by a mysterious giant.
------------------------------------------------
[00000350][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What...!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000351][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Oh, you seem to have something on your mind?
After all, you know something, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000352][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Certainly, there are many legends,
The other day, giants also attacked,
But as for "power" or something...
------------------------------------------------
[00000353][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Don't you know? Really?
Or maybe you just don't feel like talking about it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000354][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
For example, that little lady with wings over there?
You know something, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000355][パニス,char_002 Panis]
picture?  No. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000356][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Panis has nothing to do with it, Panis!
Stop getting involved!
------------------------------------------------
[00000357][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That's right. Forcing the child
I'll stop it. But for everyone else...
------------------------------------------------
[00000358][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Just a little bit,
I wonder if I should force myself to ask!
------------------------------------------------
[00000359][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Village Chief, there's something I'd like you to tell me.
Is it okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000360][ガルゼー,char_501]
I don't mind.
What happened? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000361][フリード,char_001 Fried]
among the pirates
"There's something about this island that gives it strength."
It seems like it's supposed to be...
------------------------------------------------
[00000362][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What on earth does that mean?
------------------------------------------------
[00000363][ガルゼー,char_501]
Something that brings power...
Well, this island is certainly
I'm sure it's a strange place.
------------------------------------------------
[00000364][ガルゼー,char_501]
If you only know this island, you probably don't really feel it,
Here, crops and animals
It grows really well compared to other lands.
------------------------------------------------
[00000365][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's right……
------------------------------------------------
[00000366][ガルゼー,char_501]
And, as you know,
There are many legends and stories left on this island.
Many pirates gather after hearing such stories.
------------------------------------------------
[00000367][ガルゼー,char_501]
These people are really knowledgeable about legends and myths.
For example, Bacchus.
------------------------------------------------
[00000368][ガルゼー,char_501]
Maybe the pirates
He's grasping something that we don't know...
That's possible.
------------------------------------------------
[00000369][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What do you mean by "grasping"?
------------------------------------------------
[00000370][ガルゼー,char_501]
I don't know that much.
However, deep within the forest of giant trees
If you go to the ruins, or...
------------------------------------------------
[00000371][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What are there in the ruins?
------------------------------------------------
[00000372][ガルゼー,char_501]
There are various legends related to it.
It is said that there are relics left behind.
If you go there, you might find out something.
------------------------------------------------
[00000373][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Deep in the forest of giant trees...
Understood! I'll go check it out!
------------------------------------------------
[00000374][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
However, deep in the forest of giant trees,
I had no idea a place like this existed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000375][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It's a pretty big stone statue.
------------------------------------------------
[00000376][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hey, is this kid Adam's friend?
------------------------------------------------
[00000377][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
very sorry.
there is no data.
------------------------------------------------
[00000378][パニス,char_002 Panis]
picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000379][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Some of the systems that control my body are
It seems to be malfunctioning.
Therefore, some data is missing.
------------------------------------------------
[00000380][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis, I don't understand what you're talking about.
------------------------------------------------
[00000381][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
In other words, you say,
I'm in a state where I don't remember.
------------------------------------------------
[00000382][パニス,char_002 Panis]
That's right, hmm...
------------------------------------------------
[00000383][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Ah, panis! Don't touch me unnecessarily...
------------------------------------------------
[00000384][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Wow!
------------------------------------------------
[00000385][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Yay! Ji-earthquake!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000386][パニス,char_002 Panis]
What what?
------------------------------------------------
[00000387][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Moi! Moi moi moi!
------------------------------------------------
[00000388][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
everyone! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000389][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It seems like it's settled down...
------------------------------------------------
[00000390][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Although the epicenter cannot be determined,
It seems pretty close.
------------------------------------------------
[00000391][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Too...
------------------------------------------------
[00000392][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I was surprised...
------------------------------------------------
[00000393][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What was it just now?
As soon as Panis touched the statue,
It seemed like the ground was shaking.
------------------------------------------------
[00000394][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis, aren't you shaking?
------------------------------------------------
[00000395][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, that's not what I mean...
------------------------------------------------
[00000396][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I'm more worried about the village than that.
The current shaking may have caused some damage.
------------------------------------------------
[00000397][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000398][ガルゼー,char_501]
Really.
That kind of thing...
------------------------------------------------
[00000399][フリード,char_001 Fried]
that's right. The ground started shaking...
------------------------------------------------
[00000400][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis, don't waver.
------------------------------------------------
[00000401][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah, I know.
That's not what I'm saying.
Anyway, village chief?
------------------------------------------------
[00000402][フリード,char_001 Fried]
People in the village said it wasn't shaking at all.
TRUE?
------------------------------------------------
[00000403][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Significant shaking has been recorded near the ruins.
------------------------------------------------
[00000404][ガルゼー,char_501]
Is that so.
This was completely peaceful.
The ground isn't moving at all.
------------------------------------------------
[00000405][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That would be fine...
------------------------------------------------
[00000406][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
But why is it only around those ruins?
I wonder if it shook.
------------------------------------------------
[00000407][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis, don't waver!
------------------------------------------------
[00000408][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
All right. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000409][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
The cause is currently unknown.
------------------------------------------------
[00000410][ガルゼー,char_501]
HM……
------------------------------------------------
[00000411][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What's wrong, village chief?
You look difficult...
------------------------------------------------
[00000412][ガルゼー,char_501]
No, it's nothing.
It's nothing, but it's a little unsettling.
I hope nothing happens after this.
------------------------------------------------
[00000413][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000414][ガルゼー,char_501]
Oops, sorry. She said something strange.
It is difficult to replace the elderly. Listen to me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000415][ガルゼー,char_501]
Anyway, everyone must be tired today.
You should go home and rest.
------------------------------------------------
[00000416][ガルゼー,char_501]
Probably nothing much will happen.
There's nothing to worry about.
------------------------------------------------
[00000417][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Peter, what's wrong? In a daze.
------------------------------------------------
[00000418][ピーター,char_520]
picture? I was just looking at the ruins.
Well, something strange happened.
------------------------------------------------
[00000419][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Something strange? what kind?
------------------------------------------------
[00000420][ピーター,char_520]
The sky just over there, right above the ruins,
It was glowing blue.
------------------------------------------------
[00000421][ピーター,char_520]
I feel kind of creepy while watching it
I've become so
Yube went straight into the house...
------------------------------------------------
[00000422][ピーター,char_520]
Still, I'm kind of curious,
This morning I looked at the ruins again,
The light was already gone.
------------------------------------------------
[00000423][ピーター,char_520]
It's still not shining as you can see, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000424][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree. I'm curious...
I'll go check it out at night.
------------------------------------------------
[00000425][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Freed, is it true?
At night, the ruins start to glow...
------------------------------------------------
[00000426][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I don't know, but...
Peter isn't the kind of guy to lie,
You're not the type to come up with jokes like that, are you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000427][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's certainly true.
------------------------------------------------
[00000428][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I want to see the ruins glow...
What's it like? I wonder what it's like?
------------------------------------------------
[00000429][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Hey! Look at that!
------------------------------------------------
[00000430][フリード,char_001 Fried]
a! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000431][パニス,char_002 Panis]
great! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000432][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Yes! Moi moi moi!
------------------------------------------------
[00000433][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
beautiful……
------------------------------------------------
[00000434][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
The surface temperature of the crystal is
It seems to be the same as the outside temperature.
The source of the light is unknown.
------------------------------------------------
[00000435][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What do you mean?
------------------------------------------------
[00000436][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
It's not hot to the touch,
I don't know why the light is coming out,
about it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000437][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Can I touch it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000438][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It seems okay, but be careful.
------------------------------------------------
[00000439][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah……
------------------------------------------------
[00000440][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Huh, Freed...?
Jinga...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000441][フリード,char_001 Fried]
what?
------------------------------------------------
[00000442][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
that……!
------------------------------------------------
[00000443][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
...! That is……!
------------------------------------------------
[00000444][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Crimson moon!? Then, no way...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000445][ジム,char_502]
Big brother! It's so hard!
------------------------------------------------
[00000446][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Jim!? What happened!
------------------------------------------------
[00000447][ジム,char_502]
In the cove...
That giant appeared in the cove!
------------------------------------------------
[00000448][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
what!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000449][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Let's go anyway!
Panis! here!
------------------------------------------------
[00000450][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah!
------------------------------------------------
[00000451][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Fu, Freed!? What should we do?
What to do!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000452][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No matter what you do, you have to fight!
I can't let him into the village again.
You're not going!
------------------------------------------------
[00000453][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
roger that. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000454][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
How do you say "I'll stop you"? previously,
The attack didn't work on him at all.
------------------------------------------------
[00000455][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
At that time, one more breath is all it takes to inflict a wound.
By the way, that's it.
If only there were bigger weapons...
------------------------------------------------
[00000456][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
There is no such thing!
I'm not ready!
What to do!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000457][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
...That cannon over there...
------------------------------------------------
[00000458][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Cannon!? Does it move?　Can I use that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000459][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
No, I tried it before as a countermeasure against giants, but it didn't work.
Those are just ruins.
I wish I could use it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000460][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's right...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000461][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Check your device. Start the connection.
------------------------------------------------
[00000462][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Adam?What on earth...
------------------------------------------------
[00000463][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
The cannon has started moving!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000464][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Fire control system connection completed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000465][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Can you shoot? Can you shoot it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000466][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Yes, you can shoot.
------------------------------------------------
[00000467][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
good……
I guess that's the case...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000468][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah!
With this, I might be able to defeat him!
Alright everyone, let's do our best and protect the village!
------------------------------------------------
[00000469][パニス,char_002 Panis]
picture!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000470][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Ah, that...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000471][パニス,char_002 Panis]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000Huh...?
What about Freed? What about your sister?
Everyone?
------------------------------------------------
[00000472][パニス,char_002 Panis]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000 Panis, what's wrong?
It's kind of weird...
------------------------------------------------
[00000473][パニス,char_002 Panis]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000This song...
------------------------------------------------
[00000474][パニス,char_002 Panis]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000 Panis, I know.
this……
------------------------------------------------
[00000475][パニス,char_002 Panis]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000 Huh? but……
------------------------------------------------
[00000476][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis, what's wrong?
...Panis?
------------------------------------------------
[00000477][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Too? Moimoi?
------------------------------------------------
[00000478][パニス,char_002 Panis]
……picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000479][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Are you okay? It seemed like it was flying away.
------------------------------------------------
[00000480][パニス,char_002 Panis]
No, it's okay. Panis isn't flying anywhere.
------------------------------------------------
[00000481][フリード,char_001 Fried]
yes? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000482][ジム,char_502]
Big brother of Zynga! Freed!
Did you win? Did he defeat him!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000483][ハンス,char_510]
I rushed to support him, but
Are you a little late?
------------------------------------------------
[00000484][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
sorry. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000485][ガルゼー,char_501]
Is that giant gone now?
I think I can finally sleep in peace.
------------------------------------------------
[00000486][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's right. I'm sure it'll be okay now.
It's okay... right? Panis?
------------------------------------------------
[00000487][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Uh……
------------------------------------------------
[00000488][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
what happened?
------------------------------------------------
[00000489][パニス,char_002 Panis]
you know what?I think Panis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000490][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
picture……?
------------------------------------------------
[00000491][ジム,char_502]
another……? If something like that attacks again
What should I do...
------------------------------------------------
[00000492][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's okay, Jim. I was able to defeat him this time.
I'm sure it'll be okay next time.
------------------------------------------------
[00000493][ジム,char_502]
But hey!
------------------------------------------------
[00000494][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Don't worry about that, just head straight ahead without flinching.
Weapons can even be used against giants.
We proved that this time.
------------------------------------------------
[00000495][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
And thanks to Adam
Cannons can now be used,
Even if he comes next time, he will definitely be able to protect the village.
------------------------------------------------
[00000496][ハンス,char_510]
That's right. I'm not afraid of giants anymore!
------------------------------------------------
[00000497][ガルゼー,char_501]
Hmm, I don't want to attack the enemy,
There's no need to be overly afraid.
------------------------------------------------
[00000498][ジム,char_502]
Oh, really? I do not think so.
Well, if the village chief and big brother say so...
------------------------------------------------
[00000499][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
If the enemy has the same fighting power as this time,
Defense seems possible.
------------------------------------------------
[00000500][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's right, there's nothing to be afraid of.
If everyone works together,
I'm sure it's a giant...
------------------------------------------------
[00000501][パニス,char_002 Panis]
...Hey, Freed?
------------------------------------------------
[00000502][フリード,char_001 Fried]
yeah?
------------------------------------------------
[00000503][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I want to go to the place where the stones are shining.
------------------------------------------------
[00000504][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Are the stones glowing?
Oh, by any chance, do you mean crystal?
Do you want to go to the ruins now?
------------------------------------------------
[00000505][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000506][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Understood.
Well then, let's go.
------------------------------------------------
[00000507][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (But going to the ruins this late at night...
What are you going to do? )
------------------------------------------------
[00000508][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I suddenly want to go to the ruins.
what happened? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000509][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Too?
------------------------------------------------
[00000510][フリード,char_001 Fried]
here we go. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000511][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Well, that's fine.
It's not that far away.
------------------------------------------------
[00000512][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Mr. Panis, your destination is just around the corner.
It looks like the crystal is still emitting light.
------------------------------------------------
[00000513][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000514][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
this is……
what the hell?
------------------------------------------------
[00000515][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I wonder what's going on.
When Panis starts singing,
The crystal light suddenly became strong...
------------------------------------------------
[00000516][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I don't understand.
there is no data.
------------------------------------------------
[00000517][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I don't know either.
I don't know but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000518][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But this Panis song,
For us somehow,
I feel like it gives me strength.
------------------------------------------------
[00000519][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I definitely feel like I'm feeling better
I feel like that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000520][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I see. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000521][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I don't understand, but...
There seems to be some improvement in processing speed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000522][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Not limited to this song, but
Panis has a mysterious power
It seems like he has a lot of things.
------------------------------------------------
[00000523][フリード,char_001 Fried]
And that power comes from the giants
It becomes necessary to protect the village.
That's the way it seems to me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000524][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's why I want to protect Panis.
To protect the village and everyone else.
------------------------------------------------
[00000525][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Really. Honestly, I have no idea...
------------------------------------------------
[00000526][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
If you think so,
Let's respect that decision.
I'll lend a hand to protect Panis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000527][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I agree with Freed.
Because Panis is
I saved everyone from the giants...
------------------------------------------------
[00000528][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Above all, they are my family!
------------------------------------------------
[00000529][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I got it. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000530][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Thanks guys!
What kind of opponent will appear from now on?
I have no idea though...
------------------------------------------------
[00000531][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Let's do our best and protect Panis and everyone else!
------------------------------------------------
[00000532][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Ou!
------------------------------------------------
[00000533][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
oh!
------------------------------------------------
[00000534][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
yes!
------------------------------------------------
[00000535][パニス,char_002 Panis]
oh!
------------------------------------------------
[00000536][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Too!
------------------------------------------------
