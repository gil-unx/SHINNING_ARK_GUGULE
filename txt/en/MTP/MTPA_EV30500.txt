Freed, I've been researching ruins recently.
Looks like you're quite busy though...
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][リアン,char_514]
But you know, we have to help with the reconstruction of the village, right?
Everyone is counting on you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][フリード,char_001 Fried]
O.K. I understand. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][リアン,char_514]
Well, let me help you right away.
Can you collect the hair of the giant horned mojala on the plateau?
I want to weave cloth.
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][リアン,char_514]
Whether it's clothes or curtains,
Anyway, I'm running out of cloth right now.
You know, because it burned and tore.
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Ah... why the aunt...
I thought she was going to start talking about reconstruction, but...
So that's what you wanted to ask?
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][リアン,char_514]
Hehehe, that's what it is.
May I ask?
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Of course. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Auntie, I've been there.
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][リアン,char_514]
Have you gone yet?
Thank you, that was helpful.
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's fine, that's about it.
Please come again anytime.
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][リアン,char_514]
Hehehe, then...
I'll ask you another time.
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][アリーゼ,char_504]
It’s so hard! I really want to!
Freed~! Please help my father!
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Mr. Hans?
What on earth happened?
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][アリーゼ,char_504]
Look, the other day Freed and the others...
I found a way to go beyond the mountains.
You said that, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][アリーゼ,char_504]
After hearing that story, Dad...
It seems like my old blood has started to stir up...
He went out alone!
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Alone!? That’s unreasonable! No matter how much he's a former adventurer!
I'll bring you back anyway, so just wait a moment!
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][アリーゼ,char_504]
Thank you, Freed!
Dad, I'm pretty tired, but
It doesn't seem to be life-threatening.
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][アリーゼ,char_504]
Thank you so much for your help!
Please don't do this again,
I'll explain it to you carefully, okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah……
I think it's better, really.
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][ガルゼー,char_501]
The reconstruction of the village is nearing its final stage.
The only thing left to do is fix the bathroom in my house.
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][ガルゼー,char_501]
It seems that the craftsmen are also free, so I guess it's about time.
Forever with Boris and Dalton
I can't afford to rent a bath.
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][ガルゼー,char_501]
But for that, you need stone to use for tiles.
Freed, can you go to the cliff and get it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Understood. I feel like it's been a long time so far,
The village is finally back to normal.
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Alright! Are you excited to go?
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][ガルゼー,char_501]
It must have been a lot of work.
The repair will now be completed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][ガルゼー,char_501]
The village will return to normal,
I think we'll hold a festival to commemorate that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Really!? I’m looking forward to it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][ガルゼー,char_501]
Hmm. I hope you're looking forward to it.
------------------------------------------------
