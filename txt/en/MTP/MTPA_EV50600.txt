[00000000][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Wow! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
The environment in this valley is unusual.
A dense miasma is floating around.
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It's hard to even breathe.
Is this how you want to proceed?
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
There are monsters walking around too.
You look ferocious...
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
The same goes for miasma.
If we don't get rid of those monsters,
In any case, I don't think I can move forward.
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Everyone, let's brace ourselves!
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I managed to defeat the monster, but...
It seems like the miasma is getting darker than before.
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
From this point on, the miasma becomes even denser.
Unless some measures are taken,
It will be difficult to move on.
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Like that...
I've come this far.
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Why don't you come back and try again later?
You know, a cliff cave or an oasis?
Did things change over time?
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I see, that makes sense.
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Okay, let's pull this up for now.
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][フリード,char_001 Fried]
If there are so many trees,
You can also take as much lumber as you want.
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It's fine to take as much as you want, but don't let your guard down.
I'm obsessed with collecting lumber
Will you be attacked by monsters?
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I know.
It seems better to take care of the monsters first.
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Well, the monsters were also chased away,
Shall we gather wood?
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Since it's a special festival, you want to make the decorations flashy!
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Then you need to collect a lot of lumber!
Let's do our best, Freed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
The miasma has faded considerably.
I think I can move forward with this!
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is true!
It's just as Velvet-san guessed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hehe.
With my brain,
You'll find out soon enough!
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
However, the number of monsters remains the same.
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
In fact, it looks more ferocious than during the day.
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It doesn't matter if you kick things like that away.
Let's go!
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Looks like this is the last time.
Now I can move on!
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Velvet-san, it's dangerous if you hurry like that!
Because you don't know what's ahead!
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It's noisy!
If you wait, I'll leave it behind!
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][フリード,char_001 Fried]
There are ruins here too...
However, it looks different from other ruins.
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
The entire ruins are badly damaged.
It's like being burned by flames...
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
It appears to have been damaged by high temperatures.
If you look closer,
You'll find out more.
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
First of all, let's deal with those monsters.
I have to do something.
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Ah, they are such a nuisance!
Get out of there now!
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][フリード,char_001 Fried]
The monsters around here are
Looks like you've defeated them all.
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
There are no enemy signs around.
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Well, before the monsters come back,
Let's finish investigating the ruins!
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
There's a herd of wild pigs.
This is easy to catch.
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][パニス,char_002 Panis]
There are a lot of them?
Which one will you catch?
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's right...
It's a feast for the festival,
Let's catch a big wild pig!
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
This size should be enough.
It looks like it's going to be a lavish festival!
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Everyone in the village will be happy too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Now, let's go back to the village!
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][フリード,char_001 Fried]
as many as possible
I want to collect Elvenberries and go home, but
Monsters are in the way.
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Collect monsters while being careful
It looks like my bones will break.
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It seems better to defeat the monster first.
Bring home a lot and make your aunt happy!
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Looks like there are no monsters anymore.
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Now you can collect a lot!
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree.
Collect a lot and return to the village quickly!
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
It won't interfere with the festival here.
Now, don't worry about your surroundings,
Let's do our best!
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That's very kind of you.
What are you planning?
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hey, that's a sign of composure.
Moreover, to my future citizens,
I don't want to cause resentment!
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What are you, territory people?
I won't give the island to you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Get it and show it to me! When the island becomes mine,
We'll make the festival even more exciting with the finest wine!
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
boy! However, this one is a little different this time!
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That bastard has aimed his main gun at me!
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Everyone, be careful!
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
It's a celebration of the village's recovery!
Let's give a big salute!
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Alright, you won!
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Turn your tail around and go home!
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
You want me to go home? Hey, you guys...
Do you think you've already won?
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What, are you sore loser?
It doesn't even look like you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
Hahaha, did you feel bitter about losing?
Bell, I'm being too kind to you.
It's not well-educated. Did you get too excited at the festival?
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What was that……?
Levin, what on earth do you want to say!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][レヴィン,char_009 Levin]
It's easy!
The one who wins at the very end is
That means it's me!
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Enemy entities are approaching the village!
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's it!
Even though it was restored...
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
If things continue like this, the village is in danger!
I have to do something...
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's right.
Even though it has just been restored,
I can't stand being destroyed again!
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Everyone, let's go!
Let's work together to stop him!
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It has stopped moving!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Did you do it...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][パニス,char_002 Panis]
...I'm reading.
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Panis, what's wrong?
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][パニス,char_002 Panis]
...I'm reading.
Someone is calling.
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][]
help me……
