Hmph, hun♪ Hmph, hun♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Good luck, Zynga.
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
yeah?
Oh, Freed?
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Zynga is best when fishing.
seems to be happy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Hahahaha, maybe so.
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Have you always loved fishing since you were a child?
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
No, that's not true.
It wasn't until I came to this village that I started in earnest.
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Huh, is that so!?
It's kind of surprising...
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Have I never told you?
Even though I look like this, I grew up in the mountains.
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][フリード,char_001 Fried]
eh?
Haven't you always been a fisherman?
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
In the past, I was not a fisherman, but a hunter in the mountains.
So for me, catching prey means
It was always a battle where I couldn't let my guard down even for a moment.
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Come to think of it, Zynga wasn't born and raised on an island.
It came from the continent. Maybe the fishing itself?
You had never done it before coming to the island?
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That's right. When catching fish in a mountain stream,
Because I wasn't fishing, I was using a contraption.
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hmm.
I didn't know that at all...
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Fishing is good.
In this way, you can relax and fight your prey.
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
If I had to say anything, it would be time...
It may be a battle against boredom, but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
But I was fishing
It's not often boring.
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Isn't it boring just waiting around?
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Call me stupid! Don't just wait!
Constantly keep an eye on the water surface and take note of even the slightest changes.
I have to be careful!
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It's just that I can relax,
Actually, I have to relax
There's no way I can kill my prey!
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][パニス,char_002 Panis]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hey Zynga!
Don't get so excited about Panis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Oh, sorry...
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Zynga has always been passionate about fishing.
Even when I and Zinga met for the first time,
I was yelled at like this.
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
...Is that so?
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][フリード,char_001 Fried]
that's right. I don't understand, but it seems interesting,
I was asked to learn fishing...
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
No, that was when I first met Freed.
That's not the point.
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I remember well the first time I met you.
He wasn't fishing.
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I guess so.
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That's it. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][フリード,char_001 Fried]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Well, that was a long time ago.
No wonder you don't remember.
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][フリード,char_001 Fried]
……sorry.
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It's not something to apologize for. dont 'worry.
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (But that's weird...
I can't believe that my and Zinga's memories are different...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Hmph, hun♪ Hmph, hun♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Is Zynga fishing today too?)
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Huh? It's coming from the other side...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (It's Mr. Hans. Maybe meeting up with Zynga?)
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][ハンス,char_510]
Hey, Zynga! How are you doing?
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Oh, Hans. Well, it's a blur.
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][ハンス,char_510]
That's good.
By the way, I have a question to ask, is it okay now?
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
ah. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][ハンス,char_510]
Lately, a face I haven't seen has been wandering around the island.
You know that too, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
of course. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][ハンス,char_510]
No, that's not what I'm talking about,
There's no guarantee that something won't happen in the future.
I have a young daughter at home, so I'm worried about her.
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][ハンス,char_510]
So, if something happens to you,
I wanted to get some help.
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
of course. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][ハンス,char_510]
Thank you. I feel safe when I hear those words.
The reason why our store can do business with peace of mind is that
It's because you and the vigilantes' eyes are shining.
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Ha ha ha.
Even I would be in trouble without Hans' store.
The residents of the island support each other.
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][ハンス,char_510]
If you say that much,
I'll have to buy you a drink next time.
Sorry for interrupting your fishing.
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
No. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Zynga, you still rely on me)
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Oh, it's Maia-sensei this time)
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][マイア,char_503]
Hello, Mr. Zinga.
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Hi. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][マイア,char_503]
Yes, thanks to Zynga, I can now swim.
Now I want to go to the sea almost every day, right?
That was a really big help!
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That's good.
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][マイア,char_503]
The children also want to play with Zynga,
Please stop by the school anytime if you like.
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Oh, if I had the chance.
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][マイア,char_503]
See you soon. We are waiting for you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
ah.
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Apparently, Zynga gives children at school
I think I taught you how to swim,
I didn't know that at all...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Zynga!
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Oh, Freed?
I'm getting a lot of calls from people today.
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I was watching it.
Zynga is truly relied upon.
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
This me? What are you going to say?
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][フリード,char_001 Fried]
While talking with Hans-san and Maia-sensei,
I happened to hear it.
It's amazing how everyone loves me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It's not that great.
And if there's a great guy out there, he's even better than me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Huh, who?
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I was saved by him,
I still long for it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Who is it? Let me know!
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Fufufu...
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hmm, speaking of the person who could save Zynga...
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...The village chief?
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
No, that's not true.
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's not Hans-san or Maia-sensei, right?
Or my Uncle Hiram?
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Too bad, it's off.
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Maybe Levin!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That's different too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Surrender now, Zynga.
Tell me!
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Well, if I have a chance, I will.
------------------------------------------------
[00000083][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What is it, already...
------------------------------------------------
[00000084][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (I've always admired Zynga.
What kind of amazing person is he? )
------------------------------------------------
[00000085][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Hmph, hun♪ Hmph, hun♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000086][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hi, Zynga. Are you fishing today too?
------------------------------------------------
[00000087][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
ah. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000088][ロラン,char_507]
It's a big deal!
It's a pirate!　Pirates are being attacked!
------------------------------------------------
[00000089][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What did you say! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000090][ロラン,char_507]
Oh, there it is!
Me and Carl almost got hit too!
Was scary……
------------------------------------------------
[00000091][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
what……!?
Did he even try to touch the children?
Freed, let's go!
------------------------------------------------
[00000092][フリード,char_001 Fried]
ah!
------------------------------------------------
[00000093][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Freed!? Why stop it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000094][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Why is Zynga chasing after you?
That's enough!
------------------------------------------------
[00000095][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
They even tried to touch children!
You can't afford to miss these guys!
------------------------------------------------
[00000096][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I've tortured you enough, and I won't come again!
Or are you planning on cornering me until I kill you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000097][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
nothing……!
------------------------------------------------
[00000098][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
...That's right.
I don't know about that...
------------------------------------------------
[00000099][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Have you calmed down a little?
------------------------------------------------
[00000100][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
……ah.
------------------------------------------------
[00000101][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What the hell happened?
It didn't seem like the usual Zynga, did it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000102][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
sorry.
I just can't forgive people like that.
Maybe it just got too hot.
------------------------------------------------
[00000103][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
As Freed said,
If you corner me into a corner and hold a grudge against me,
On the contrary, it may cause trouble to the village.
------------------------------------------------
[00000104][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That's definitely...
It must be avoided at all costs...
------------------------------------------------
[00000105][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Apart from me,
I didn't mean to put that much thought into it, but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000106][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
This island, this village is everything to me...
I definitely don't want to do anything that will cause trouble...
------------------------------------------------
[00000107][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Zynga...
------------------------------------------------
[00000108][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (I knew Jinga cared about the village...
I wonder what it is, it seems like today was different than usual...
For the first time since I met him, I thought Zynga was scary...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000109][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Zynga.
------------------------------------------------
[00000110][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
...Oh, Freed?
------------------------------------------------
[00000111][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I'm not feeling well. what's wrong with you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000112][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
...I'm sorry, Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000113][フリード,char_001 Fried]
eh?
What are you talking about all of a sudden?
------------------------------------------------
[00000114][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It's about the pirates from before.
If you didn't stop me,
I would have made a big mistake.
------------------------------------------------
[00000115][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That story should have been over by now, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000116][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
No, I need to reflect on this and correct my habit of getting angry.
I might do the same thing again.
------------------------------------------------
[00000117][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Zynga...
------------------------------------------------
[00000118][ガルゼー,char_501]
Zynga! Is the fish you ordered still available?
------------------------------------------------
[00000119][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Ah, village chief, I'll catch it right away, so please wait a little longer.
------------------------------------------------
[00000120][ガルゼー,char_501]
Shall I wait over there?
Freed and Panis-chan also make sure not to get in the way.
Come here.
------------------------------------------------
[00000121][フリード,char_001 Fried]
eh?
------------------------------------------------
[00000122][ガルゼー,char_501]
Apparently they drove away Zynga and the pirates.
------------------------------------------------
[00000123][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Did you ask Roland?
------------------------------------------------
[00000124][ガルゼー,char_501]
ah. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000125][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But since then, somehow
Zynga acts strange sometimes.
------------------------------------------------
[00000126][ガルゼー,char_501]
What do you mean by strange?
------------------------------------------------
[00000127][フリード,char_001 Fried]
How about self-reflection, or how to fix a habit that makes you lose your temper?
You said that as soon as you saw my face.
------------------------------------------------
[00000128][ガルゼー,char_501]
Isn't that fine?
A man who didn't trust people that much had turned into a complete person.
------------------------------------------------
[00000129][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Are you saying that Zynga didn't trust people in the past?
------------------------------------------------
[00000130][ガルゼー,char_501]
That's it. In the past, it was more glaring.
------------------------------------------------
[00000131][ガルゼー,char_501]
So...I was against it at first too.
Don't put him in the village.
------------------------------------------------
[00000132][フリード,char_001 Fried]
eh!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000133][ガルゼー,char_501]
If you place Zynga in the village,
I thought it would definitely bring disaster.
Not just me, but almost everyone in the village.
------------------------------------------------
[00000134][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is that so!? I can't believe it...
I can't believe you thought that about Zynga.
------------------------------------------------
[00000135][ガルゼー,char_501]
However, there were some men who didn't think so.
Thanks to that man,
So we didn't make any mistakes.
------------------------------------------------
[00000136][ガルゼー,char_501]
Now that I think about it, that person's way of looking at people is very important.
At that time, Zynga, who has a strong personality, simply
He had figured out that he was just being sad.
------------------------------------------------
[00000137][ガルゼー,char_501]
accept the person's appeal,
It was the right decision to reconsider Zynga's treatment.
Zinga is now an indispensable presence in the village.
------------------------------------------------
[00000138][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hey... there were people like that too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000139][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Oh, by any chance,
The ``man of my dreams'' that Zynga was talking about...
------------------------------------------------
[00000140][ガルゼー,char_501]
Actually, Freed...
------------------------------------------------
[00000141][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Look, you caught it, village chief!
------------------------------------------------
[00000142][ガルゼー,char_501]
What?!
------------------------------------------------
[00000143][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Feel free to bring it home.
------------------------------------------------
[00000144][ガルゼー,char_501]
What, such a stupid big fish?
Are you asking me to carry it by myself?
------------------------------------------------
[00000145][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Of course I'll deliver it home with you. Look!
------------------------------------------------
[00000146][ガルゼー,char_501]
Oops!
------------------------------------------------
[00000147][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Ah, village chief!
------------------------------------------------
[00000148][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Ah, I missed the important part.
------------------------------------------------
[00000149][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Well, whatever. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000150][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Zynga.
------------------------------------------------
[00000151][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
...Oh, Freed?
------------------------------------------------
[00000152][ロラン,char_507]
That's a big deal!
Pirates are on the loose again!
Those guys from the other day are here again!
------------------------------------------------
[00000153][フリード,char_001 Fried]
eh!?
They said they would never come again...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000154][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000155][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Zynga...
------------------------------------------------
[00000156][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
More on that later. Just hurry!
------------------------------------------------
[00000157][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No!
------------------------------------------------
[00000158][フリード,char_001 Fried]
If it doesn't work, Zynga!
There's no need to go that far!
------------------------------------------------
[00000159][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Don't stop Freed!
If you leave them alone,
Repeat the same thing over and over again!
------------------------------------------------
[00000160][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
There's no guarantee that the village won't be damaged someday!
Before that happens, those guys...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000161][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Just because of that, don't kill me!
It's just like pirates!
You can chase it away as many times as you like until you get punished!
------------------------------------------------
[00000162][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
But that won't be enough to protect the village!
------------------------------------------------
[00000163][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I can protect it!
This is how I've been protecting you until now!
Because Zynga was there, we were able to protect you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000164][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
...!?
Because I'm here...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000165][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Freed... that's...
it is……
------------------------------------------------
[00000166][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Zynga?
What happened...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000167][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
...That's what I thought at that time, too.
That led to me letting my guard down.
So, I...
------------------------------------------------
[00000168][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I couldn't protect my hometown...
------------------------------------------------
[00000169][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Zinga...?
What do you mean...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000170][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
When I was on the continent, the village I lived in was
I was attacked by bandits...
------------------------------------------------
[00000171][フリード,char_001 Fried]
eh!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000172][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I was in charge of protecting the village, just like I am now.
He defeated the bandits by himself.
However, I let them go because I was begging for my life.
------------------------------------------------
[00000173][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I believed them. That caught me off guard.
While I was out shopping in town,
They're coming back...
------------------------------------------------
[00000174][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture……?
------------------------------------------------
[00000175][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
The village is wiped out. From old people to children,
Not a single person survived.
I had no choice but to curse. My sweetness...
------------------------------------------------
[00000176][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I found the bandits,
I treated them like the villagers.
But even if you do that, they won't come back.

And my heart never returned to the way it was.
I can't trust anyone or forgive myself,
I got off the mountain...
------------------------------------------------
[00000178][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Walking and walking, walking to the ends of the earth,
I threw myself into the sea that I saw for the first time.
But he didn't die and ended up on this island.
------------------------------------------------
[00000179][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That kind of thing...
------------------------------------------------
[00000180][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That's why I can't forgive people like that.
He casually hurts people, breaks promises,
There are people who attack villages without hesitation even if they are rescued.
------------------------------------------------
[00000181][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
If you leave people like that alone,
This village may also be seen as my hometown.
I can't stand that!
------------------------------------------------
[00000182][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
This village is my last home...
------------------------------------------------
[00000183][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Zynga...
------------------------------------------------
[00000184][フリード,char_001 Fried]
……Are you okay!
After all, as long as Jinga is here, this village will be fine!
------------------------------------------------
[00000185][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
……What does it mean?
------------------------------------------------
[00000186][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's how much Jinga cares about the village,
Are you protecting me?
Isn't it safe no matter who comes?
------------------------------------------------
[00000187][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
No, but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000188][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Besides, Jinga isn't the only one protecting the village.
We are there too. You're not alone!
------------------------------------------------
[00000189][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No matter how many times they come,
If we all work together, we will definitely be able to protect it!
It won't be like Zynga's hometown!
------------------------------------------------
[00000190][フリード,char_001 Fried]
that's why……
That's why I can't protect the village without taking my life...
Don't say such sad things...
------------------------------------------------
[00000191][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Freed...
------------------------------------------------
[00000192][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Even if I say that, they won't come anymore.
I think so.
After all, I promised you twice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000193][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Fufu...fufufu...
When it comes to you...
The depth of her bosom is bottomless...
------------------------------------------------
[00000194][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture? Oh, no. That's not true.
------------------------------------------------
[00000195][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
No, there is.
In fact, thanks to your patience, I am
This is how I can stay here.
------------------------------------------------
[00000196][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What do you mean?
------------------------------------------------
[00000197][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
This is a story about when I came to this island.
At that time, I was really depressed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000198][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
To everyone in the village who helped me,
It ended like he was trying to eat me,
The village chief also said, ``We can't put it on the island.''
------------------------------------------------
[00000199][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000200][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I myself felt like I should do whatever I wanted.
If I get kicked out, I'll jump into the sea again.
That was my idea of ​​abandonment.
------------------------------------------------
[00000201][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
But you didn't allow it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000202][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Me?
------------------------------------------------
[00000203][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
You held my hand tightly as I tried to leave the village,
He looked up into my eyes and refused to leave.
------------------------------------------------
[00000204][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Don't leave, just live here...
It's like saying that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000205][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
The village chief also saw this and changed his mind.
He said he could leave me in the village for a while.
------------------------------------------------
[00000206][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
From that day on, I also changed my mind.
For the benefactor who kept me alive,
And I decided to live for this village.
------------------------------------------------
[00000207][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That happened...
I don't remember at all...
------------------------------------------------
[00000208][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
No wonder.
Are you only sensible?
Because I was that old.
------------------------------------------------
[00000209][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
From that moment on, you were for me.
He's the man I've always admired...
------------------------------------------------
[00000210][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Eh, yeah!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000211][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Jinga's story is the same as what I heard from the village chief.
I didn't think so...
------------------------------------------------
[00000212][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
...Hehe.
Well, that's what it is.
See you then.
------------------------------------------------
[00000213][フリード,char_001 Fried]
The man Zynga admired was me...
------------------------------------------------
