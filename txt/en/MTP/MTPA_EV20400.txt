Velvet-san, you're in a good mood.
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Ah, Freed.
You look like you're doing well too.
That's right, can you come with me if you like?
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Where are you going?
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It's at the village chief's place. He's invited to dinner.
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Isn't that an important topic to talk about?
Even if I go even though I'm not invited...
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It's okay.
Isn't it more fun to eat with a group of people?
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis, I'm hungry.
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
hey? Welcome both of you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Wow!　Rice with Soncho~♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Well, okay.
Well, I guess I'll be invited too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][ガルゼー,char_501]
What's wrong, Freed, do you need something?
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Soncho, I'll take it♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][ガルゼー,char_501]
Hello, Panis-chan.
What does itadakimasu mean...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Let's eat dinner together with Velvet♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][ガルゼー,char_501]
what!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Isn't that okay, village chief?
Along with Panis and Freed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][ガルゼー,char_501]
What, is that so...
It's okay.
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (village chief, are you feeling a little miffed...?
Well, eating alone with Velvet,
I'm sure you were looking forward to it...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It's nice to have lunch outside.
Thank you for your invitation, Mayor.
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][ガルゼー,char_501]
Hey.
Thank you for coming.
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Let's eat!
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Does the village chief always eat alone?
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][ガルゼー,char_501]
Well, that happens a lot.
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
So let's have fun today.
hey? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][フリード,char_001 Fried]
eh? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][ガルゼー,char_501]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (After all, we are like pests...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][ガルゼー,char_501]
Even so, it's velvet.
You're beautiful and talented, so why are you a pirate?
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Already! If you're the village chief, you're good at it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][ガルゼー,char_501]
No, no, hahahaha.
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I also played pirates,
I've traveled all over the world and seen many places,
This island is truly amazing!
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][ガルゼー,char_501]
Oh, I see?
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
All the men are gentlemen, kind and strong...
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][ガルゼー,char_501]
Hmm... I see?
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Everyone is good to me...
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][ガルゼー,char_501]
No, no...I see, I see.
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Especially the village chief. Really Su Te Ki ♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][ガルゼー,char_501]
Guho!! Guho!!
M-water...
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Are you okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What are you doing...
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Yes, water!
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][ガルゼー,char_501]
Nggh...ngh...huh...
Please surprise me suddenly...
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I was the one who was surprised!
If you're the village chief, it's already...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][ガルゼー,char_501]
No, I'm sorry...
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I did something that would surprise the village chief.
Did I mention it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][ガルゼー,char_501]
No, no, I was praised by a young and beautiful woman.
Just then...
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Oh dear? I'll be wary, okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][ガルゼー,char_501]
nothing?
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
The village chief believes that's not the case...
There are really a lot of perverted guys in the world.
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Until now, here and there
An old man who uses his power to make me fall in love with him.
You came here with a bang, didn't you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][ガルゼー,char_501]
No, I would never do something like that...
My credo is to be kind to everyone.
Hey, Panis-chan?
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
yes? Now, enjoy your meal!
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
...What's wrong, Freed?
I've been silent since a while ago.
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, it's Velvet-san after all.
I thought he was a kind and nice person.
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What, all of a sudden... well, that's fine.
For me, to those who are kind to me,
The principle is to respond with kindness.
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Let's continue to get along well♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yes, nice to meet you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hmm...
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Velvet-san, what's wrong?
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Oh, Freed. I'm exploring the island.
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is that a map in your hand?
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
that's right.
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Let me see a little.
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
No good.
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Huh?　Just a little bit is enough!
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Are you saying no?
It's my map.
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh yeah...
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Well, at least tell me where you got it.
Isn't that enough?
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I didn't get it, but
I made it myself. Me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Eh!? Is it true?
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What do you mean!? I don't have a map.
Are you saying you can't make it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, well...what can I say...
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I can't even teach such a rude child!
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][フリード,char_001 Fried]
sorry! That map looks so neat,
I thought it was made by a professional craftsman.
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
No problem, if you're a pirate
If you can't draw a map like this, you won't be able to go on land.
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is this a map you created by walking around it yourself?
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
No, it's not.
This map was created just by listening to various stories from the village chief,
In this way, we actually walk around and check the accuracy.
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Wow!
Well then, let me help you too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Dear Mr.
I have enough hands on my own.
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Huh? "Can't you just show it to me?"
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Pirates show us their own maps.
It's like revealing your secrets to others, right?
That's a pointless consultation.
------------------------------------------------
[00000083][フリード,char_001 Fried]
In particular, I looked into Velvet-san's hands,
I have no idea what to do!
------------------------------------------------
[00000084][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Do you think you can believe that? “Yes, I see.”
You're so sweet too...
------------------------------------------------
[00000085][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Well, just one last thing, please!
------------------------------------------------
[00000086][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What?
------------------------------------------------
[00000087][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I have one too, like Velvet has now.
Create an elaborate island map!
I think it's convenient to have!
------------------------------------------------
[00000088][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Geez...
------------------------------------------------
[00000089][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I'll think about it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000090][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What do you mean by thinking about it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000091][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Are you really worthy of being trusted by a man?
I have to show you a little more.
------------------------------------------------
[00000092][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (I'm still in Velvet's eyes,
He doesn't seem like a man worthy of trust...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000093][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Understood! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000094][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Fufufu...
Okay, good luck.
------------------------------------------------
[00000095][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hmm...
------------------------------------------------
[00000096][フリード,char_001 Fried]
that? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000097][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
If you ask me to show you the map, I'll refuse.
------------------------------------------------
[00000098][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I won't talk about that anymore.
I wonder if he's a man I can trust.
Let's start there, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000099][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hehehe, I know.
See ya!
------------------------------------------------
[00000100][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Velvet, you went alone?
Isn't it dangerous?
------------------------------------------------
[00000101][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Ah, that's right.
I can't show you anything unless I'm with you...
Let's chase!
------------------------------------------------
[00000102][フリード,char_001 Fried]
see you later.
------------------------------------------------
[00000103][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Oh, how about a map?
For that purpose, I would like to
You wanted to show me, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000104][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Yeah, honestly, that's what I was thinking.
This is very Velvet-san,
There's no way you can trust me. I'll start again.
------------------------------------------------
[00000105][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hmm...
I like such an honest man.
Right on. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000106][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What!? Is it okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000107][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Didn't you want to see it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000108][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Of course I want to see it, but
I was surprised because it was so sudden...
------------------------------------------------
[00000109][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
At this rate, I'll end up in your debt.
It seems like it will happen.
I don't like that kind of thing, so please be grateful.
------------------------------------------------
[00000110][フリード,char_001 Fried]
thank you!
Hmm, which one...
Wow, that's really well done!
------------------------------------------------
[00000111][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That's what I made. Of course.
------------------------------------------------
[00000112][フリード,char_001 Fried]
All the places marked with this X are ruins, right?
Are you looking for something in the ruins?
------------------------------------------------
[00000113][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Maybe so.
------------------------------------------------
[00000114][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But speaking of what Velvet is looking for,
That's the "power" you always talk about, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000115][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I wonder.
------------------------------------------------
[00000116][フリード,char_001 Fried]
So, is this a map depicting the location of "power"?
------------------------------------------------
[00000117][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I hope so.
------------------------------------------------
[00000118][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hmm, the map was as elaborate as I expected...
Is this in Velvet's hands?
I don't really understand...
------------------------------------------------
[00000119][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I don't need you to understand.
Well, it's almost over.
------------------------------------------------
[00000120][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah...yes, I'll give this back.
thank you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000121][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
see you later!
------------------------------------------------
[00000122][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Velvet-san, I wonder what you're doing...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000123][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hey you!
Have you seen a man around here?
------------------------------------------------
[00000124][フリード,char_001 Fried]
eh!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000125][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It's okay if you haven't seen it.
He's a fast runner...
------------------------------------------------
[00000126][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Wait, Velvet?
What on earth happened!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000127][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It's none of your business! Shut up!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000128][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Shit...what happened to me...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000129][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hey, what happened?
Velvet-san, you look amazing...
------------------------------------------------
[00000130][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Don't be rude!
------------------------------------------------
[00000131][パニス,char_002 Panis]
That pot is scary.
------------------------------------------------
[00000132][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Scary...do you look that terrible?
------------------------------------------------
[00000133][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah.
------------------------------------------------
[00000134][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
yes……
Oh no...if I do...
------------------------------------------------
[00000135][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Didn't you say that you were able to escape?
------------------------------------------------
[00000136][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
...Yes, that's right.
------------------------------------------------
[00000137][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
...What I did was that I wanted old maps.
I was tricked by a peddler I didn't know,
They ran away with my money!
------------------------------------------------
[00000138][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Peddlers aren't people from the village, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000139][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Yeah, I don't think so.
At least it was the first face I saw today.
------------------------------------------------
[00000140][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I can't leave such a person alone!
Let me know, I'll look for it too! What kind of person was he?
------------------------------------------------
[00000141][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
...That's enough.
------------------------------------------------
[00000142][フリード,char_001 Fried]
eh!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000143][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It's my fault for being deceived.
It was strange of me to trust someone I met for the first time...
------------------------------------------------
[00000144][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That’s it!
There is no way that being deceived is worse!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000145][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Is that so? It's not something you can believe, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000146][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That's why... that's why,
You need the strength to not give in to it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000147][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Power...I can't believe it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000148][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
So. But next time I see you, I'll beat you up,
I'll get my money back. That and this are different stories.
------------------------------------------------
[00000149][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I can never forgive someone who cheats me out of money.
------------------------------------------------
[00000150][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Do not do it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000151][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
What I do without even knowing it,
Please don't stick your neck out!
------------------------------------------------
[00000152][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000153][フリード,char_001 Fried]
……sorry……
------------------------------------------------
[00000154][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Huh...
------------------------------------------------
[00000155][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
You're really honest.
This doesn't make me look stupid for being angry.
------------------------------------------------
[00000156][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Mr. Velvet...
------------------------------------------------
[00000157][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That's all for now.
See you soon.
------------------------------------------------
[00000158][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Velvet-san... that's the first time I've seen her...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000159][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hmm...
------------------------------------------------
[00000160][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Growling while looking at the map again...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000161][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Oh, I was wondering who it was, and it turned out to be you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000162][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Velvet-san, things were bad the other day.
------------------------------------------------
[00000163][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
...I forgot that old story.
------------------------------------------------
[00000164][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
See ya. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000165][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh wait...!
------------------------------------------------
[00000166][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is there “power” here?
------------------------------------------------
[00000167][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It's actually possible, isn't it?
I was looking for the power of ancient civilization...
Looks like I was in trouble here too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000168][フリード,char_001 Fried]
...Hey, Velvet-san?
Why do you want "power" so much?
------------------------------------------------
[00000169][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000170][フリード,char_001 Fried]
After all, I said it the other day.
Is it because they cheat or don't give in?
------------------------------------------------
[00000171][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
...You keep coming at me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000172][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah... After all, I can't leave my friends alone.
Besides, I said, "Don't even know me well."
Is it Ms. Velvet?
------------------------------------------------
[00000173][フリード,char_001 Fried]
So, I would like you to tell me about Velvet-san.
------------------------------------------------
[00000174][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Wow.
...Well, okay. I'll talk to you.
In some way, I'm indebted to you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000175][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
My house was just an ordinary house you could find anywhere.
It's just an ordinary house in the middle of nowhere.
Except for the fact that I'm extremely poor.
------------------------------------------------
[00000176][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Although my parents were serious and hardworking,
No matter how hard you work, your life will only get harder.
I thought it was strange, but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000177][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Still, my clumsy parents
All I can do is work hard...
So...he died.
------------------------------------------------
[00000178][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I found out later.
That I had been deceived by a powerful person in the village.
In short, I had been tricked.
------------------------------------------------
[00000179][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I will never forgive anyone who defrauds me of money.
That's what I mean...
------------------------------------------------
[00000180][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I desperately appealed to you, but
No one will deal with me...
Rather, it's a matter of powerful people applying pressure through their power.
------------------------------------------------
[00000181][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That's what I thought at that time.
If I or my parents had the power,
I wish I didn't have to give in to something like this.
------------------------------------------------
[00000182][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I can't even stay in the village anymore than the powerful people,
I decided to take the plunge and go out to sea.
In search of "power" that won't give in to anything.
------------------------------------------------
[00000183][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It seems like the pirate business suited me.
I would never try to scam people out of money, but
Other than that, it's pretty boring.
------------------------------------------------
[00000184][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Besides, my beauty will be my weapon.
I noticed it.
One wink will make a man fall in love with you. It's a little bit.
------------------------------------------------
[00000185][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
However, in the end, power has the say.
After all, I'm a weak girl.
There are limits to how much you can get through with wisdom and beauty.
------------------------------------------------
[00000186][フリード,char_001 Fried]
So "power"...
------------------------------------------------
[00000187][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It doesn't matter. Anything that has "power".
There are many ruins and folklore on this island, and there is something about ancient civilization.
I was looking for something to see if it existed, but to no avail.
------------------------------------------------
[00000188][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh I see……
I, without knowing anything,
Sorry for saying so many things.
------------------------------------------------
[00000189][フリード,char_001 Fried]
However, after knowing a lot,
Once again, Velvet's thoughts are,
I think it's wrong.
------------------------------------------------
[00000190][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's bad to deceive people,
To screw it down with force,
That's definitely not good.
------------------------------------------------
[00000191][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Besides, people can believe it. At least that's what I believe.
Even if it means being betrayed hundreds of times,
I won't stop believing.
------------------------------------------------
[00000192][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I believe in Velvet-san,
I want Velvet to believe me too.
When you are in trouble, I will definitely help you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000193][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
...If I could live my life believing in others like you,
Maybe we don't need "power" in the first place.
------------------------------------------------
[00000194][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
But hey, I said it, right?
I was a good fit.
After all, this is the only way to live.
------------------------------------------------
[00000195][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I'm sure I'll be looking for another "power" again.
------------------------------------------------
[00000196][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hehehehe...
------------------------------------------------
[00000197][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hahahaha!
------------------------------------------------
[00000198][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Well, I'll try my best to make people trust me a little more.
------------------------------------------------
[00000199][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I'd like to see Velvet like that too.
------------------------------------------------
[00000200][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Then you might cheat again, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000201][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No matter how many times I've been fooled,
I will continue to believe in Velvet!
------------------------------------------------
