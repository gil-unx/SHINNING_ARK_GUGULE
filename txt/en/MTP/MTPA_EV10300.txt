[00000000][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Today seems no different than before.
It doesn't seem to shine as strongly as it did originally.
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis, what was the song yesterday?
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][パニス,char_002 Panis]
When that child left, I remembered.
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Does that kid mean giant?
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah. I thought I had to sing here.
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
So I tried singing it and it sounded like that
Does that mean the crystal has begun to shine?
I don't really understand...
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Anyway, once again while it's still bright
Let's investigate the ruins.
Maybe I can find something...
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][？？？,char_601]
I found! A terrifying demon that once destroyed the world!
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What are you talking about? No, no!
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][？？？,char_601]
Here it is! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Alert!Found the intruder!
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
What! Who are you!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
My name is Kill Maria!
To save the people of the world,
I'm an exorcist who exorcises evil!
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
In the name of heaven and earth and justice,
I'll exorcise that demon!
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Is it the devil?
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What, a devil?
Where is that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Are your eyes blind?
Look, there you are!
A devil with wings!
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Have wings? By any chance, you're talking about Panis!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][パニス,char_002 Panis]
picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Moi!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
that's right! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Wow! stop!
It's dangerous, so put it away!
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
What are you doing! Please move out of the way!
You can't shoot the devil!
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
You don't have to shoot! I mean, don't shoot!
There's no way Panis is the devil!
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Momomo, momomo!
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
no! From the results of my research,
There is no doubt about it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
That child was once destroyed by an evil force.
Bringing destruction to all of Endias,
He is the devil who destroyed ancient civilization!
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis!? No way!
That can't happen!
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
no!Therefore, I was sleeping in the ruins of the continent,
I tried to exorcise that demon, but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I let the devil escape before I could,
I've been chasing you for a long time!
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][パニス,char_002 Panis]
……Is that so?
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Are you trying to pretend you don't know and cheat?
Even if you make a cute voice like that,
My Justice will not be discouraged!
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Because, Panis, you don't know about your sister, do you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
……teeth?
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I was chased or something like that.
You don't remember it at all?
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
really?
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah.
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
W-what do you mean?
I'm sure we should have met at those ruins!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
When I tried to exorcise,
I'm sure it has disappeared somewhere,
I'm sure you saw the face!
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Aren't you stupid?
I'm sure that's the case!
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I do not remember……
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Ever since Panis arrived on this island,
He's lost his memory.
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
What was that!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Besides, Panis isn't a devil!
You have saved our village many times!
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
picture?What do you mean!?
How could the devil do such a thing?
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I think it's because he's not a demon?
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Well, that's...
However, legends and traditions...
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][フリード,char_001 Fried]
If it were a legend, it would even exist on this island.
According to island legend, Panis is not a devil.
I guess he's an angel.
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
What!? The devil is an angel!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It's an ancient language, so we can't read it, but
There are also stone monuments related to this story in this ruins.
I'm told it's still there.
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I was also in this ruins.
If you'd like, why not check it out?
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I see, that information is certainly interesting.
……got it!
Now, let's investigate those ruins.
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Let me tell you,
Even if I try to take that opportunity to let the child escape,
It's a waste!
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
If you make any strange movements,
Bang bang in the name of justice!
Sounds good!
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][フリード,char_001 Fried]
understood……
By the way, Mr. Kilmaria.
What is Justice?
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Justice!
It is a message of justice descending from heaven!
It is the light of wisdom that flashes in the hearts of the righteous!
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Descending from the sky...? A flash...?
Does that mean... "gut feeling"?
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
wrong! Justice is Justice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's right.
sorry……
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (Somehow, a strange person came...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Th-This is……!
Interesting...too interesting...!
But, but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][フリード,char_001 Fried]
copper? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Because we can't read ancient languages
I can't say anything...
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Something like Freed explained earlier
Is it written?
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I agree. It is engraved with the legend of an angel who tried to save the world.
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
However, in any legend
Different legends are common.
This alone is...
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][フリード,char_001 Fried]
However, the fact that conflicting stories have emerged means that
There is room for doubt in what I have researched so far.
Doesn't that mean it came out?
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I can't help but say that,
However, just this one example...
It does not overturn the descriptions in the vast amount of other historical sources.
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What. If that's the case, why not check out other ruins as well?
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Other ruins? Ah, I did something like that earlier.
That's what you said.
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah. We don't know all the places, but
If you were the village chief, I'm sure you would know.
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I see, you're the village chief...
got it! May I ask you to meet me?
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Understood. Tell me anytime.
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I asked for it. For today,
I would like to concentrate on investigating this ruins.
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Let me tell you!
If you ever try to deceive me...
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Bang bang! right?
I know you won't do that.
see you later then.
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Kill Maria! Bye bye!
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Oh, yes……
That's it! Please don't be too familiar with me!
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][フリード,char_001 Fried]
The village chief, someone who actually wants to meet the village chief.
I brought him...
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
You are the village chief!
Please tell me the location of the ruins!
Thank you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][ガルゼー,char_501]
...Freed. this person is?
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][フリード,char_001 Fried]
This person is Kilmaria.
Panis must be the devil
He's insistent. So...
------------------------------------------------
[00000083][ガルゼー,char_501]
HM. Are you trying to show me the ruins?
------------------------------------------------
[00000084][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
You are right. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000085][ガルゼー,char_501]
That's right. I don't know if it will help, but
There must have been ancient ruins on the cape as well.
------------------------------------------------
[00000086][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Cape! Ruins! I see!
There certainly seems to be some important information!
------------------------------------------------
[00000087][ガルゼー,char_501]
Ah, ah...
You should go and try it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000088][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yes, I'll go!
And the hidden truth under justice
Let's expose it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000089][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
That is my mission given to me by God!
Oh, how wonderful!
------------------------------------------------
[00000090][ロラン,char_507]
Hey, who is this older sister?
------------------------------------------------
[00000091][メリー,char_509]
I don't know. But isn't it interesting?
------------------------------------------------
[00000092][カール,char_508]
Is this tippo real?
------------------------------------------------
[00000093][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Hey! Your butt will bang!
------------------------------------------------
[00000094][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Well, Mr. Kilmaria.
If you're ready, why don't you go now?
------------------------------------------------
[00000095][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
picture?Are you guys going too?
------------------------------------------------
[00000096][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah, I'm just going to show you around.
------------------------------------------------
[00000097][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I refuse! With people who may be the devil's followers,
Cannot accompany!
That is against justice.
------------------------------------------------
[00000098][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Currently, we are working together,
Is that okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000099][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
That's it, this is it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000100][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
...Well, I won't force you to do it if you don't want to, but...
Do you know the way?
------------------------------------------------
[00000101][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
cormorant……
------------------------------------------------
[00000102][ガルゼー,char_501]
Besides, there are a lot of monsters on the cape.
I think it would be better to ask them to escort you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000103][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Well, if that's the case,
There is no way. If you see any suspicious movements...
------------------------------------------------
[00000104][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Bang bang! right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000105][ロラン,char_507]
Hahaha!
------------------------------------------------
[00000106][カール,char_508]
Bang bang! Bang Bang!
------------------------------------------------
[00000107][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Momoi! Moimoi!
------------------------------------------------
[00000108][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah! Bang Bang!
------------------------------------------------
[00000109][メリー,char_509]
Panis is also bang bang!
------------------------------------------------
[00000110][パニス,char_002 Panis]
yay! Bang Bang!
------------------------------------------------
[00000111][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
picture?Am I doing something strange?
------------------------------------------------
[00000112][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It's okay. Let's go quickly.
Don't worry about the details.
------------------------------------------------
[00000113][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Ha, ha...
------------------------------------------------
[00000114][フリード,char_001 Fried]
This is the ruins that the village chief was talking about.
------------------------------------------------
[00000115][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
copper? ……that? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000116][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Over there.
------------------------------------------------
[00000117][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Hey, this is it! This style is definitely
Characteristics of the early Enfield civilization!
Then, what is engraved here is...
------------------------------------------------
[00000118][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
wonderful……!
Rarely seen even on the continent.
Isn't there a ton of special historical materials?
------------------------------------------------
[00000119][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I don't really understand, but
It seems like you were pleased.
------------------------------------------------
[00000120][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It's been a long time since I've been able to eat it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000121][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
this is?
I see, this is the legend of an angel that is passed down on this island...
Is it a stone monument with that written on it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000122][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Did you find it? What does it say?
------------------------------------------------
[00000123][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
please wait a moment. This part is too blurry to read, but next...
"I came down to save the world..."
------------------------------------------------
[00000124][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
What was that!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000125][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
What do you mean?
Although other accounts do not contradict other historical sources,
This is the only thing that is definitely different...
------------------------------------------------
[00000126][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Apparently Panis isn't the devil.
Does it seem written?
------------------------------------------------
[00000127][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Oh, yeah. However, I have many
According to the results of a literature survey,
This child is definitely a demon...
------------------------------------------------
[00000128][パニス,char_002 Panis]
picture?Why are you staring at Panis?
------------------------------------------------
[00000129][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
However, when we talked about it up close like this,
It is hard to believe that such an existence exists.
This is also my honest opinion...
------------------------------------------------
[00000130][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
in? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000131][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Even if you ask me, "What's wrong?"
I can't come to a conclusion quickly...
However, I don't think this inscription is fake.
------------------------------------------------
[00000132][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Besides, apparently there is more to it than this.
Relics related to "angels"
It seems that it is left behind...
------------------------------------------------
[00000133][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
got it!I will stay on this island and continue my investigation!
------------------------------------------------
[00000134][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
A mountain of historical materials left in the ruins,
Demon... no, observation of Mr. Panis's own behavior!
There are so many things to investigate!
------------------------------------------------
[00000135][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's right. But hey,
If that's the case, I welcome it.
Well then, let's go back to the village...
------------------------------------------------
[00000136][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
What are you talking about?
I still don't trust you
There isn't!
------------------------------------------------
[00000137][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But what about food?
------------------------------------------------
[00000138][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Uh...that's...
------------------------------------------------
[00000139][フリード,char_001 Fried]
it is?
------------------------------------------------
[00000140][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Eh...
I-I'll do it somehow...
------------------------------------------------
[00000141][フリード,char_001 Fried]
……Understood. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000142][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
really!My favorite food is cream bread!
------------------------------------------------
[00000143][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yes yes...
------------------------------------------------
[00000144][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
However, camping alone is dangerous.
I cannot recommend it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000145][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Are you okay! We have this gun!
------------------------------------------------
[00000146][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
When some monsters came near,
I'll protect myself as well as I can!
------------------------------------------------
[00000147][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Well, if you're okay with it,
He doesn't force it, but...
------------------------------------------------
[00000148][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Hey, Freed. In addition to meal delivery,
Sometimes you should come and check on me
It might be good...
------------------------------------------------
[00000149][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree……
------------------------------------------------
[00000150][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Auntie, did you deliver bread today?
------------------------------------------------
[00000151][リアン,char_514]
Ah, just in the right place.
I was thinking of ordering a delivery.
------------------------------------------------
[00000152][リアン,char_514]
Sleeping in the ruins of the cape,
It's about that strange kid.
------------------------------------------------
[00000153][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What about Kilmaria?
Understood. That's what I was thinking of, so I'll be there for a while.
------------------------------------------------
[00000154][パニス,char_002 Panis]
It's Kill Maria!
Bang bang, bang! Are you going to deliver it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000155][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Bang bang, bang! Because!
Ahahahahaha!
------------------------------------------------
[00000156][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Moi moi moi!
------------------------------------------------
[00000157][ロラン,char_507]
Oh, Panis, bang! of
Are you going to visit your sister?
------------------------------------------------
[00000158][メリー,char_509]
I want to go too!
That lady is so funny!
------------------------------------------------
[00000159][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000160][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hey, wait a minute, Panis!
I can't take my kids to a place like that!
Even monsters will appear!
------------------------------------------------
[00000161][ロラン,char_507]
What is it? Panis is good
Are we no good?
Zurizo, Freed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000162][カール,char_508]
We want to go too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000163][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hey, Freed, isn't it okay?
Bring everyone too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000164][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Even panis!? It can't be helped...
Everyone must never leave me, right?
Also, don't do anything on your own! nice?
------------------------------------------------
[00000165][ロラン,char_507]
Understood!
------------------------------------------------
[00000166][メリー,char_509]
I'll do it properly, so it's okay!
------------------------------------------------
[00000167][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Well then, everyone, head towards the cape.
Shuppatsu! Yes!
------------------------------------------------
[00000168][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It was a troublesome delivery...
already.
------------------------------------------------
[00000169][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Kill Maria! It's bread!
We also have cream bread!
------------------------------------------------
[00000170][カール,char_508]
Keer Mariya!
------------------------------------------------
[00000171][メリー,char_509]
Bang bang!
------------------------------------------------
[00000172][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Thank you for waiting. Is it delivery?
------------------------------------------------
[00000173][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
thank you very much.
But what about these kids?
------------------------------------------------
[00000174][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I don't know why, but you, the children of the village
It's very popular, isn't it? Because I want to meet you,
I brought her.
------------------------------------------------
[00000175][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Ha, ha... I see.
I don't really understand...
------------------------------------------------
[00000176][カール,char_508]
oh! What is this stone?
------------------------------------------------
[00000177][メリー,char_509]
Look, look, Panisou!
This flower is beautiful!
------------------------------------------------
[00000178][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Oh! So amazing!
------------------------------------------------
[00000179][ロラン,char_507]
Which one?
------------------------------------------------
[00000180][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Look! this!
Isn't it really beautiful?
------------------------------------------------
[00000181][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
...Mr. Panis gave you flowers?
------------------------------------------------
[00000182][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
The devil loves a small flower
Is it something to do...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000183][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Mr. Kilmaria? what happened?
------------------------------------------------
[00000184][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
picture? excuse me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000185][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Well, it's not really a problem.
How about more research?
------------------------------------------------
[00000186][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Is it a survey? I agree. The more I investigate, the more new facts emerge.
Every day is very fulfilling!
------------------------------------------------
[00000187][フリード,char_001 Fried]
It seems difficult though...
Somehow, even more than when we first met,
I feel more alive.
------------------------------------------------
[00000188][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Ah, that may be so.
When people spend their time doing what they like,
Because it brings out the tension in life.
------------------------------------------------
[00000189][フリード,char_001 Fried]
thing of interest?
------------------------------------------------
[00000190][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
yes. This is how we investigate the past.
I love you already...
------------------------------------------------
[00000191][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Of course, it is important to know about past events.
This is necessary for the duties of an exorcist,
That being said, I love this kind of research.
------------------------------------------------
[00000192][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's right.
------------------------------------------------
[00000193][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
However, most of the facts that appear this time are
Something that contradicts the historical materials left on the continent.
Just the content...
------------------------------------------------
[00000194][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Honestly, how do you interpret it?
It's also a fact that is bothering me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000195][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That means Panis is not a devil.
That means you've come to understand, right?
Did you finally get it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000196][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Do you agree? no!The research has not progressed to a satisfactory level yet!
------------------------------------------------
[00000197][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hmm...
It's pretty stubborn.
------------------------------------------------
[00000198][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
My research on the continent must have been perfect!
I can hardly believe that it was a mistake!
------------------------------------------------
[00000199][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Above all, Justin
That's what I told you!
Although……
------------------------------------------------
[00000200][ロラン,char_507]
ah! Looks delicious! Give it to me too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000201][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Wait a minute?　
I'm dividing it up now so everyone can eat it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000202][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Snacks taste better when eaten together!
Hehehehehe!
------------------------------------------------
[00000203][ロラン,char_507]
Is that so! Well then, let's all eat mine too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000204][カール,char_508]
Mine too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000205][メリー,char_509]
Mine too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000206][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
...read the inscription about the angel,
When I saw Mr. Panis like that,
It is also true that questions arise.
------------------------------------------------
[00000207][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's right……
------------------------------------------------
[00000208][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
difference! I finished my meal.
We need to continue our investigation!
------------------------------------------------
[00000209][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Thank you for delivering the bread.
Please give my best regards to Rian as well.
------------------------------------------------
[00000210][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Thank you for your dinner!
If possible, try a less sweet bread next time!
------------------------------------------------
[00000211][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Zynga, what's wrong? It's kind of noisy though.
------------------------------------------------
[00000212][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Dangerous! 　
------------------------------------------------
[00000213][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Wow!
------------------------------------------------
[00000214][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What!? This!
------------------------------------------------
[00000215][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It's shelling! Bacchus has acquired some strange wisdom!
They're firing at us from above the sea with cannons!
------------------------------------------------
[00000216][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Can't we fire back from here?
------------------------------------------------
[00000217][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
There are no cannons here!
The cannon that was fired at the giant is now being brought here.
However, I wonder if I will make it in time...
------------------------------------------------
[00000218][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
But, to think he would use such a move...
Isn't Bacchus too quick-witted?
------------------------------------------------
[00000219][フリード,char_001 Fried]
And it doesn't look like Bacchus. everytime,
There are people who say, ``Get the treasure fairly and squarely.''
It's not something you should do, right? this.
------------------------------------------------
[00000220][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's right. A “treasure” that never existed!
Didn't he realize that and get angry?
------------------------------------------------
[00000221][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I don't think so...
What exactly is the change in your state of mind?
------------------------------------------------
[00000222][バッカス,char_527]
Gaaaaaaaaaaaa!
What do you think?　My ship is so strong!
------------------------------------------------
[00000223][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
a! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000224][バッカス,char_527]
If you're going to hand over the treasure to me,
Ask your buddy
It's okay to stop the bombardment!
------------------------------------------------
[00000225][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Partner? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000226][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Bacchus! Don't say nonsense,
Keep shooting!
------------------------------------------------
[00000227][バッカス,char_527]
I understand, Bell.
If you say so, me,
I'll shoot as many as I want!
------------------------------------------------
[00000228][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Why, now! That's not Velvet's voice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000229][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I see, that's his wisdom...
------------------------------------------------
[00000230][ジム,char_502]
Big brother of Zynga! The cannon has arrived!
The vigilantes are loading the ship right now!
------------------------------------------------
[00000231][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Are you leaving by boat?
------------------------------------------------
[00000232][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Do you think it is possible to fire back from here?
------------------------------------------------
[00000233][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It would be fine if you are used to shelling,
We can't really hit it.
I need to get even a little closer to them.
------------------------------------------------
[00000234][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
This is my first time fighting on a ship...
I wonder if I can do it properly...
------------------------------------------------
[00000235][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I don't know.
But you have to try!
------------------------------------------------
[00000236][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hmm. I see.
I lost, but I could see the other side's weaknesses.
As I thought, those guys aren't good at fighting on ships...
------------------------------------------------
[00000237][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
There seems to be plenty of opportunity to take advantage of it...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000238][バッカス,char_527]
Really! It's worth it for me to work hard too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000239][バッカス,char_527]
The ship broke down a little bit, though.
I'll fix it quickly, so let's work together again!
------------------------------------------------
[00000240][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Two people? What are you talking about? You.
------------------------------------------------
[00000241][バッカス,char_527]
picture? The two of you will join hands to get the treasure, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000242][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Ah, that story. Sorry, but that's not the case.
The combination will be resolved.
------------------------------------------------
[00000243][バッカス,char_527]
Eh!? W-why!? W-what's wrong with me?
Did you do something bad? Was there something wrong?
If so, I'll fix it! that's why……
------------------------------------------------
[00000244][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
There's no end to my complaints about you!
That's not the problem...
------------------------------------------------
[00000245][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That I don't need you anymore.
It's pretty useless!
To put it bluntly, you're fired!
------------------------------------------------
[00000246][バッカス,char_527]
Yeah? Eeeee ℃￥?　Eh, eh, eh!?
That's right ℃ー￥!
------------------------------------------------
[00000247][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Somehow I won...
Honestly, it was tough.
------------------------------------------------
[00000248][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree.
It was my first time fighting between ships.
------------------------------------------------
[00000249][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
very sorry. It is not installed on me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000250][パニス,char_002 Panis]
It was shaking all the time, so I felt uncomfortable...
------------------------------------------------
[00000251][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Too...
------------------------------------------------
[00000252][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
As for the ship itself, that one is better suited for battle,
If Bacchus raises his arm, I might give up.
------------------------------------------------
[00000253][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Without even waiting for Bacchus to raise his arm,
If other pirates...for example, Levin attack with a ship,
There's nothing I can do about it at the moment.
------------------------------------------------
[00000254][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hmm...
------------------------------------------------
[00000255][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed, what's wrong?
Is Freed disgusting too?
------------------------------------------------
[00000256][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No. What comes from the sea is
I guess it's not just pirates.
------------------------------------------------
[00000257][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What do you mean?
------------------------------------------------
[00000258][フリード,char_001 Fried]
In other words, a giant like the other day appeared in the sea,
He didn't go up to the island,
If he were to attack while still in the sea...
------------------------------------------------
[00000259][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
nothing……!
------------------------------------------------
[00000260][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis also said, ``Maybe another child will come.''
It's not impossible, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000261][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Since the identity of the enemy is unknown,
Is this a situation that can be fully anticipated?
------------------------------------------------
[00000262][フリード,char_001 Fried]
If that happens,
I wonder what I should do...
------------------------------------------------
[00000263][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Hmm...
Anyway, I need to take measures quickly.
But what should I do...
------------------------------------------------
[00000264][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Lana, would you mind?
There's something I'd like to discuss with you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000265][ラナ,char_528]
consultation? What what?
------------------------------------------------
[00000266][フリード,char_001 Fried]
In fact, recently, pirates have been attacking the island.
They started attacking from the top of the ship...
------------------------------------------------
[00000267][ラナ,char_528]
On the ship...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000268][ラナ,char_528]
Hmm, I see.
To the enemy attacking from the sea,
How should I fight against it...
------------------------------------------------
[00000269][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Until now, we have never thought of using ships to fight.
Because I had never thought about it.
I have no idea what to do.
------------------------------------------------
[00000270][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
If you have any advice please
I'd like to hear it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000271][ラナ,char_528]
Even if you say that, I think so too.
There's no chance to fight using a ship...
------------------------------------------------
[00000272][ラナ,char_528]
Well, sometimes you can meet pirates,
Most of the time, I manage to escape by making use of my boat feet.
------------------------------------------------
[00000273][ラナ,char_528]
a! Yes, this.
------------------------------------------------
[00000274][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
what? “Sea wolf speaks a lot”…?
------------------------------------------------
[00000275][ラナ,char_528]
It's a memoir written by a privateer captain from some country.
There are detailed accounts of my experiences in battles using ships.
There's also talk of modifying the ship, so it might be helpful.
------------------------------------------------
[00000276][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I see……
------------------------------------------------
[00000277][ラナ,char_528]
I guess that's all I can do.
All that's left is to do your best and help Zynga plan the modification of the ship.
Why don't you try standing it up?
------------------------------------------------
[00000278][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I?
------------------------------------------------
[00000279][ラナ,char_528]
Because out of all of us, the one who knows the most about the sea and ships is
Isn't it Zynga? In that case, Zynga would be the right person.
Are you okay! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000280][ラナ,char_528]
Well then, I have a business meeting so this is it.
Good luck!
------------------------------------------------
[00000281][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Oh, oh...
------------------------------------------------
[00000282][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Zynga, what does it say?
------------------------------------------------
[00000283][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Well, wait. Let's read it first.
------------------------------------------------
[00000284][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
got it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000285][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Story! Tell me a story!
------------------------------------------------
[00000286][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, Panis. This isn't that kind of book.
So, Zynga. What was written?
------------------------------------------------
[00000287][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
"If your ship is inferior in firepower to the enemy ship,
Think about increasing your speed.''
------------------------------------------------
[00000288][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
``Also, preparations to protect against incoming shells.
It must not be taken lightly."
------------------------------------------------
[00000289][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I see. How do you specifically apply it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000290][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That's right. Whatever you do,
Anyway, I need materials.
Let's go to the forest and collect lumber and materials for sails.
------------------------------------------------
[00000291][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I got it. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000292][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Wow! Are you stronger than before? Hey, are you strong!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000293][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Well... that's right.
Speaking of getting stronger,
It should be stronger than before.
------------------------------------------------
[00000294][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What's up, Zynga?
Even though I was able to strengthen my ship,
She doesn't have a funny look on her face.
------------------------------------------------
[00000295][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It was certainly possible to strengthen it, but
How common is this?
That's what I thought...
------------------------------------------------
[00000296][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Not even giants, but pirates,
I don't know if I have a chance of winning.
After all, we are amateurs.
------------------------------------------------
[00000297][フリード,char_001 Fried]
There's nothing to worry about.
Zynga is very knowledgeable about the ocean.
------------------------------------------------
[00000298][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Of course, when it comes to the sea,
I think I know,
If it's a fish, I won't lose to anyone.
------------------------------------------------
[00000299][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
However, the opponent is a pirate ship, much less a giant.
I don't even know how to fight.
------------------------------------------------
[00000300][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
At least someone knows how to fight at sea.
If you're on my side...
I guess it's quite different...
------------------------------------------------
[00000301][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I see……
------------------------------------------------
[00000302][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But, Zynga. I took the trouble to strengthen the ship,
Let's try to fight as well as possible!
------------------------------------------------
[00000303][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That's right. That's all I have for now.
------------------------------------------------
[00000304][フリード,char_001 Fried]
oh yeah. Maybe I'll learn how to fight better...
------------------------------------------------
[00000305][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (But the best thing is that the enemy doesn't attack from the sea.
I'll give it to you though. Especially that giant...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000306][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Mr. Kilmaria, are you there?
I came to check on you.
What do these ruins look like?
------------------------------------------------
[00000307][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Kill Maria! Are you there?
------------------------------------------------
[00000308][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yes......
------------------------------------------------
[00000309][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture?  what happened?
Do you look pale somehow?
------------------------------------------------
[00000310][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Kill Maria, are you sick?
------------------------------------------------
[00000311][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
picture? It's just that I haven't slept for about 3 days...
------------------------------------------------
[00000312][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Are you not sleeping!? Why!
------------------------------------------------
[00000313][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
That's right, there are quite a few ruins here.
There are many interesting relics...
------------------------------------------------
[00000314][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
While I was researching this and that,
I forgot to sleep and eat...
------------------------------------------------
[00000315][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Haven't you eaten yet? The bread has arrived, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000316][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed, there's a lot of bread over there...
------------------------------------------------
[00000317][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Why are you so reckless again...
------------------------------------------------
[00000318][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Um...
------------------------------------------------
[00000319][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis? Where are you going?
------------------------------------------------
[00000320][パニス,char_002 Panis]
yes! Would you like to eat this?
------------------------------------------------
[00000321][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
……picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000322][パニス,char_002 Panis]
No good? I have to eat properly.
Are you going to get sick?
------------------------------------------------
[00000323][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Momoi moi, momoi?
------------------------------------------------
[00000324][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Ha, ha...
------------------------------------------------
[00000325][パニス,char_002 Panis]
So, yes, this. Did you eat bread?
Because Freed and his sister baked the bread,
Isn't it very delicious?
------------------------------------------------
[00000326][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Are you... worried about me...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000327][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
thank you.
So, following your advice,
I'll take this bread...
------------------------------------------------
[00000328][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000329][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
you……
Maybe it's not the devil.
------------------------------------------------
[00000330][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Mr. Kilmaria...
------------------------------------------------
[00000331][パニス,char_002 Panis]
There's no such thing as a bear.
Panis is panis, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000332][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Hehehe, that's right.
Please excuse me, Mr. Panis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000333][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But...anyway, aside from that,
This life is too reckless.
I know you're busy with research.
------------------------------------------------
[00000334][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Is there anything I can help you with?
Isn't this bad for your health?
------------------------------------------------
[00000335][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Can you help me?
That's helpful.
Actually, I heard from the village chief...
------------------------------------------------
[00000336][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
In a cave on a cliff along the coast
Apparently there are ruins.
I was thinking of going there to investigate the other day...
------------------------------------------------
[00000337][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
In the end, I couldn't find the entrance to the ruins,
He has returned.
------------------------------------------------
[00000338][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
After all, the monsters that appear around there are
It's too strong, I can't handle it by myself...
------------------------------------------------
[00000339][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Wait a minute?
I don't know what you want me to help you with...
------------------------------------------------
[00000340][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yeah. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000341][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I guess that's what it is...
What I said was
That's not what I meant though.
------------------------------------------------
[00000342][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
However, as Kilmaria,
Can't you help but worry about the ruins?
------------------------------------------------
[00000343][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
If you can't find the entrance,
You can't rest in peace.
------------------------------------------------
[00000344][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
that's right! Oops……
------------------------------------------------
[00000345][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hey, are you okay!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000346][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
It seems to be dizziness due to fatigue.
take care.
------------------------------------------------
[00000347][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Oh my, I can't help it.
Okay, I'll help you find the entrance.
------------------------------------------------
[00000348][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Instead! In the meantime, Kill Maria should take a good rest.
It's really bad if you don't sleep properly.
------------------------------------------------
[00000349][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Freed is right.
Good? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000350][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Good!
------------------------------------------------
[00000351][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yes, I understand.
Thank you……
------------------------------------------------
[00000352][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
You found the entrance to the ruins!
Thank you for your cooperation!
------------------------------------------------
[00000353][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000354][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Killmaria is so energetic!
------------------------------------------------
[00000355][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yeah. I took a nap until everyone returned.
------------------------------------------------
[00000356][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Really. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000357][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Thanks to you, I feel better,
I would like to go there right away.
------------------------------------------------
[00000358][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
from now? Shall we do it tomorrow?
------------------------------------------------
[00000359][フリード,char_001 Fried]
that's right. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000360][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
is that so. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000361][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Come to think of it, I thought that earlier too...
You're the first one to act with us.
You hated it, didn't you? Is it okay now?
------------------------------------------------
[00000362][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's right. Are you trying to exorcise Panis?
I stopped saying it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000363][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Oh, that's that...
Times were different then and now.
No, it's only been a few days...
------------------------------------------------
[00000364][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Above all, I am here like this.
Thanks to your kindness, we are able to continue our research.
Taking that into consideration, what can I say...
------------------------------------------------
[00000365][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Kilmaria, please calm down.
Based on human customs, you
It sounds like you're joking.
------------------------------------------------
[00000366][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
picture!?
Oh, is that so? I agree. Eh...hmm...
------------------------------------------------
[00000367][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
As Mr. Panis wrote on the island's relics,
Regardless of whether or not he is the one who will save the world,
As for whether he is a demon...
------------------------------------------------
[00000368][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I think there is a lot of room for doubt.
It's up to you to decide. yes.
------------------------------------------------
[00000369][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Therefore, we conducted further investigation,
Until that conclusion is reached, Mr. Panis
I'm not trying to exorcise it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000370][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
“If in doubt, don’t exorcise!”
This is the correct way of justice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000371][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I don't really understand it, but
I felt relieved for the time being.
------------------------------------------------
[00000372][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Well then, I'll come and pick you up before going to the cave on the cliff.
I think you should rest today.
------------------------------------------------
[00000373][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
That might be better.
See you tomorrow!
------------------------------------------------
[00000374][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Hello Kilmaria,
No, maybe it's already "Good evening"?
Are you ready to go out?
------------------------------------------------
[00000375][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
yes! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000376][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I'm as excited as ever.
Are you looking forward to seeing the ruins?
------------------------------------------------
[00000377][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yeah! It's always fun!
Hurry up and let's go to the cliff cave!
------------------------------------------------
[00000378][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It's good that you're fine.
By the time we reached the cliff cave,
You might run into a slightly stronger opponent.
------------------------------------------------
[00000379][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
No problem!
In the name of Justice,
You can defeat monsters in no time!
------------------------------------------------
[00000380][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
So everyone, let's go!
------------------------------------------------
[00000381][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I finally arrived...!
Let's start investigating!
------------------------------------------------
[00000382][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Good luck, Kilmaria.
------------------------------------------------
[00000383][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Well, what should we do in the meantime?
------------------------------------------------
[00000384][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I'll just relax and go fishing.
Panis, Adam, do you guys want to try it too?
------------------------------------------------
[00000385][パニス,char_002 Panis]
fishing? Panis also catches fish!
------------------------------------------------
[00000386][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Hahaha, I see.
Well then, let's make a trick.
What will Adam do?
------------------------------------------------
[00000387][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
There is a change in spatial mass.
Someone may be using teleportation magic.
------------------------------------------------
[00000388][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
what? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000389][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Adam, can you explain this to me?
------------------------------------------------
[00000390][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
In other words……
------------------------------------------------
[00000391][？？？,char_601]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000392][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What!? What, you!
Where did it come from?
------------------------------------------------
[00000393][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Who is your sister?
------------------------------------------------
[00000394][？？？,char_601]
...Are you Panis?
------------------------------------------------
[00000395][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000396][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Yes, that was good. You're not the same person, are you?
I'm Viola.
------------------------------------------------
[00000397][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
I came to kill you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000398][パニス,char_002 Panis]
picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000399][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis, let's run!
------------------------------------------------
[00000400][パニス,char_002 Panis]
No!
------------------------------------------------
[00000401][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Moi!
------------------------------------------------
[00000402][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
I won't let you escape!
------------------------------------------------
[00000403][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Ha, ha, ha...
------------------------------------------------
[00000404][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis... are you okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000405][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
It's not okay.
------------------------------------------------
[00000406][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Wow!
------------------------------------------------
[00000407][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yay!
------------------------------------------------
[00000408][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
It's a waste.
------------------------------------------------
[00000409][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Wait please!Why are you targeting Panis?
------------------------------------------------
[00000410][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
I'll tell you later. After killing.
------------------------------------------------
[00000411][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Oh no! It's scary!
------------------------------------------------
[00000412][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
That's it! If you move even one step,
I'll hit Justice right in your head!
------------------------------------------------
[00000413][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
do not bother.
------------------------------------------------
[00000414][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
no! Apparently you too, Mr. Panis.
It seems like you think he's the devil?
------------------------------------------------
[00000415][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
……teeth?
------------------------------------------------
[00000416][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
However, to conclude that Mr. Panis is a devil is
It seems unfounded.
Certainly, in the records and ancient documents left on the continent...
------------------------------------------------
[00000417][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
There is a description of a devil who looks like Mr. Panis.
You can see it. But on the other hand, on this island,
There are many historical documents that deny this.
------------------------------------------------
[00000418][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
In addition, Mr. Panis' own words and actions,
What is the devil left in ancient documents?
It's like a far cry...
------------------------------------------------
[00000419][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Perhaps she is the devil mentioned in ancient texts.
Those with a similar appearance are
I think it's just a coincidence. Therefore...
------------------------------------------------
[00000420][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
The reason I killed this child is
It has nothing to do with that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000421][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
I will kill this child
But this child is here now.
It's just that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000422][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
What was that!?
you are not a devil or anything
Just a weak girl...
------------------------------------------------
[00000423][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Just because I'm there
Are you trying to kill me?
------------------------------------------------
[00000424][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
That alone is enough.
Get out of there.
------------------------------------------------
[00000425][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
What...
I can't forgive...!
I will never forgive you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000426][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
In the name of God and Light and Justice,
It is not Mr. Panis who should be exorcised!
It's you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000427][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Kill Maria!
------------------------------------------------
[00000428][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Mr. Freed! everyone! With Viola over there,
Let us teach you the importance of life!
------------------------------------------------
[00000429][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
here we go! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000430][ヴァイオラ,char_003 Viola]
Next time, it won't be like this...
I'll definitely kill you...
------------------------------------------------
[00000431][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Had disappeared……?
------------------------------------------------
[00000432][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Target transfer confirmed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000433][フリード,char_001 Fried]
good. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000434][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
But I said, "Next time."
It's hard enough just to be a giant, but for someone like that...
------------------------------------------------
[00000435][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Freed...
older sister……
it's okay? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000436][パニス,char_002 Panis]
That person came again,
Everyone will protect me!
It's always like that!
------------------------------------------------
[00000437][パニス,char_002 Panis]
That's why Panis is not scary!
------------------------------------------------
[00000438][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That's it. Freed and Shannon, and me and Adam...
I'll definitely take you...
------------------------------------------------
[00000439][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
And me too!
I will protect Mr. Panis too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000440][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
what?
------------------------------------------------
[00000441][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Ki, Kill Maria?　
Because Kilmaria-san...
------------------------------------------------
[00000442][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yeah. However, the ruins and Mr. Panis himself
Result from the research……
------------------------------------------------
[00000443][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Mr. Panis is not the devil.
He became convinced.
He does not exorcise anyone who is not a demon.
------------------------------------------------
[00000444][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It took quite a while, but
I'm glad that you seemed to understand.
------------------------------------------------
[00000445][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Yeah, I understand!
Now that I understand, I am Mr. Panis.
I want to be on the side of protecting it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000446][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Protecting innocent people from malicious people
That is what Justice is,
It's the most just justice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000447][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Well, I don't really understand the meaning of the word, but
I'm happy to help you anyway.
Thank you for your continued support.
------------------------------------------------
[00000448][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Nice to meet you, too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000449][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I see. It seems like the ages are almost the same.
You can see that from the design here.
------------------------------------------------
[00000450][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
However, what exactly is this stone statue?
I can't quite grasp that.
------------------------------------------------
[00000451][フリード,char_001 Fried]
That's right……
By the way, Mr. Kilmaria?
Why are you still investigating?
------------------------------------------------
[00000452][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Why?
------------------------------------------------
[00000453][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Because Panis isn't the devil.
You understand, right?
If that's the case, there's no need for any more research, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000454][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Oh, is that what you mean?
Well...it's just pure curiosity...
------------------------------------------------
[00000455][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
……Do not you care about this?
The true identity of Mr. Panis.
Who on earth is he?...
------------------------------------------------
[00000456][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis' true identity?
------------------------------------------------
[00000457][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That’s true…
------------------------------------------------
[00000458][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hey Hey! I found this! this!
------------------------------------------------
[00000459][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hey! Don't disturb me, come here.
------------------------------------------------
[00000460][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Panis, don't get in the way.
I'll help you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000461][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Hey, Kill Maria? Even though it's this big,
I'll decorate you with flowers, okay? I'm sure it's cute?
------------------------------------------------
[00000462][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
So don't touch the statues unnecessarily.
Because he might fall.
------------------------------------------------
[00000463][パニス,char_002 Panis]
It's okay. Ehehe. Yes, please!
------------------------------------------------
[00000464][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yay!
------------------------------------------------
[00000465][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
It's like an earthquake.
Please ensure your own safety.
------------------------------------------------
[00000466][フリード,char_001 Fried]
earthquake!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000467][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Yes!
------------------------------------------------
[00000468][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Well, it looks like things have settled down.
------------------------------------------------
[00000469][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I was surprised……
Does this island have many earthquakes?
------------------------------------------------
[00000470][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
No, not really.
I'm sure this happened before...
……Wait?
------------------------------------------------
[00000471][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Panis? Did you do something to the statue just now?
------------------------------------------------
[00000472][パニス,char_002 Panis]
picture?I just decorated it with flowers.
------------------------------------------------
[00000473][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Does that mean he touched the stone statue?
I'm sure the other day, when I touched a stone statue at another ruin...
------------------------------------------------
[00000474][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
A similar phenomenon occurred,
Does that mean?
------------------------------------------------
[00000475][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Come to think of it, yes.
After a while, that giant...
------------------------------------------------
[00000476][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
nothing……
------------------------------------------------
[00000477][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hmm...
------------------------------------------------
[00000478][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Anyway, why don't you go back to the village?
Kill Maria is also with me.
I'm starting to get a little worried.
------------------------------------------------
[00000479][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Ha, ha. got it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000480][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I hope nothing happens...
------------------------------------------------
[00000481][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Eh, um...
Panis... I didn't do anything?
------------------------------------------------
[00000482][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Yeah, I know.
Are you okay. 
------------------------------------------------
[00000483][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah……
------------------------------------------------
[00000484][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Zynga, what's wrong?
Staring at the sea with a troubled face.
------------------------------------------------
[00000485][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Did you find a school of fish?
------------------------------------------------
[00000486][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
No, that's strange.
The sea is strangely quiet...
------------------------------------------------
[00000487][フリード,char_001 Fried]
The sea?
------------------------------------------------
[00000488][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
ah. It's nice to have a bit more wind and bigger waves.
But today... it's too quiet.
------------------------------------------------
[00000489][フリード,char_001 Fried]
…………
------------------------------------------------
[00000490][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000491][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Too!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000492][パニス,char_002 Panis]
that?
------------------------------------------------
[00000493][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
What? What is it!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000494][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It seems like something is happening at sea.
Did Freed's premonition come true...
------------------------------------------------
[00000495][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
What is that!?
A big...fish?
------------------------------------------------
[00000496][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I can't wait to see such a big fish!
------------------------------------------------
[00000497][パニス,char_002 Panis]
I'm here again...
------------------------------------------------
[00000498][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Panis!? What happened?
------------------------------------------------
[00000499][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Again... another child came...
------------------------------------------------
[00000500][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Another child?
After all, he's a friend of that giant...
If so, the village is in danger!
------------------------------------------------
[00000501][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Is the village in danger...?
Is that big fish targeting the village?
------------------------------------------------
[00000502][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I do not understand. It caused considerable damage to the village.
------------------------------------------------
[00000503][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
That's right. If Panis wasn't there at that time,
What happened to the village...
------------------------------------------------
[00000504][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I see……!
I see...that's right!
I finally understand!
------------------------------------------------
[00000505][フリード,char_001 Fried]
What?
------------------------------------------------
[00000506][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Why me?
I guess I decided to come to this island!
------------------------------------------------
[00000507][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
It was all God's guidance!
Defeat the devil and save the people!
------------------------------------------------
[00000508][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
a little bit! Weren't you supposed to agree?
------------------------------------------------
[00000509][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
wrong! That monster is the devil!
------------------------------------------------
[00000510][フリード,char_001 Fried]
picture?
------------------------------------------------
[00000511][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Do your utmost to destroy with great power,
Make good people suffer and suffer!
That is exactly the devil's work!
------------------------------------------------
[00000512][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I can't let this go!
Let's do it! My Justice is about to explode!
------------------------------------------------
[00000513][フリード,char_001 Fried]
But where will we fight?
In the cove the other day, he was so big.
I don't think it will fit...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000514][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
indeed.
At that size, it was only possible to enter the cove,
Islands and villages may be destroyed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000515][フリード,char_001 Fried]
So I guess I have no choice but to go by that ship.
If you get close to him and he gets violent, immediately use a cannon...
------------------------------------------------
[00000516][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
A cannon...
However, the strengthening of the tsukiyaki blade
Will it work for that big guy?
------------------------------------------------
[00000517][フリード,char_001 Fried]
it's okay! I did what I could.
I have no choice but to believe it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000518][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
That's right. Let's set sail!
------------------------------------------------
[00000519][パニス,char_002 Panis]
a……
------------------------------------------------
[00000520][パニス,char_002 Panis]
that……?
------------------------------------------------
[00000521][パニス,char_002 Panis]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000 again...
It's the same as the other day...
------------------------------------------------
[00000522][パニス,char_002 Panis]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000 Song...
I heard it the other day...
I don't know where it comes from, but the song...
------------------------------------------------
[00000523][パニス,char_002 Panis]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000But this is different.
It's a different song the other day...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000524][パニス,char_002 Panis]
@lt1@fs16@dt2@db1@dcFF000000 Going there again?
Yeah... that's right...
------------------------------------------------
[00000525][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis! It's Panis!
------------------------------------------------
[00000526][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Moimoi!　Moi!
------------------------------------------------
[00000527][パニス,char_002 Panis]
yeah……?
Ah, Freed...
Everyone……
------------------------------------------------
[00000528][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Good, I woke up...
------------------------------------------------
[00000529][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I was surprised.
Because I suddenly lose consciousness...
------------------------------------------------
[00000530][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah, sorry.
You know, Freed.　
Panis, I want to go to the ruins again.
------------------------------------------------
[00000531][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Remains?
------------------------------------------------
[00000532][パニス,char_002 Panis]
The place with the huge Kurihikaru.
------------------------------------------------
[00000533][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Kurihikaru? Oh, Crystal?
Speaking of which, the other day...
------------------------------------------------
[00000534][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
If you take Panis with you,
I started singing and Crystal reacted.
------------------------------------------------
[00000535][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Did something like that happen?
I would love to see that!
------------------------------------------------
[00000536][フリード,char_001 Fried]
I agree. Shall we go again this time?
I'm curious as to what will happen...
------------------------------------------------
[00000537][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Panis...?
What is it now? What on earth is this...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000538][鋼鱗丸,char_530]
Yes!
------------------------------------------------
[00000539][パニス,char_002 Panis]
do not know. Then this happened.
------------------------------------------------
[00000540][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I see. All in all, very interesting!
------------------------------------------------
[00000541][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
What is depicted with light is
There is no doubt that it is a magic circle,
The components are completely unknown...
------------------------------------------------
[00000542][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
What kind of effect was it aimed at?
This alone is indescribable.
------------------------------------------------
[00000543][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Probably in the ruins on the island.
I think there may be a hint...
Hmmmm...
------------------------------------------------
[00000544][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Also, Kilmaria's inquisitive spirit,
Looks like it caught fire.
------------------------------------------------
[00000545][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I don't understand. Such a strange thing,
I was shown off one after another.
------------------------------------------------
[00000546][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Killmaria-san, are you going to stay in the ruins for a while again?
Shall I deliver the bread later?
------------------------------------------------
[00000547][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
However, this crystal itself also
Something else...
picture? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000548][フリード,char_001 Fried]
No, it's fine.
Anyway, I'll bring you the bread later.
------------------------------------------------
[00000549][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (according to Kill Maria's research,
I hope the mystery of that monster and Panis will be solved.
I'm glad I made some strong friends.)
------------------------------------------------
[00000550][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
It hurts! I got hit in the head by Crystal!
Another strange phenomenon has occurred!
------------------------------------------------
[00000551][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
No, I wasn't hit by Crystal.
She was bumped into by Mr. Kilmaria.
It's just backwards carelessness.
------------------------------------------------
[00000552][フリード,char_001 Fried]
@fcFFAAFFAA (I guess it's reassuring...)
------------------------------------------------
[00000553][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Hey, Panis.
Hey, could you please try this on?
------------------------------------------------
[00000554][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Wow! New clothes!
Clean...
------------------------------------------------
[00000555][リアン,char_514]
Panis-chan, in her clothes
You came to this island, right?
So I prepared it with Shannon.
------------------------------------------------
[00000556][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...However, grass, nuts, etc.
I just dyed it in different colors.
Panis seems to like that dress.
------------------------------------------------
[00000557][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah, Panis, I love this outfit!
That's why I'm glad it comes in a variety of colors!
------------------------------------------------
[00000558][リアン,char_514]
Hehe, I'm glad you liked it.
I'll keep it here, so you can change it whenever you like.
------------------------------------------------
[00000559][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
If I ever get other clothes,
I'd like you to leave it here with me.
------------------------------------------------
[00000560][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Good for you, Panis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000561][パニス,char_002 Panis]
Yeah!
------------------------------------------------
