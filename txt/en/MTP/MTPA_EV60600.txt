[00000000][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
I want it to be a good memory for the whole family.
------------------------------------------------
[00000001][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
How can I have fun?
------------------------------------------------
[00000002][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Making memories with Panis and me...
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Is it a festival?
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
This is my first time attending Panis at a festival.
memorable,
I want to make it a fun festival.
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Freed, say something nice!
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Alright! I also got my father and mother involved,
Celebrate Panis with the whole family
Let's have fun!
------------------------------------------------
[00000007][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Geez...
That's it! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000008][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...What's with that delicate face?
------------------------------------------------
[00000009][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...Wait a minute, Freed.
Was it on purpose that I was left out?
------------------------------------------------
[00000010][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Freed, what's wrong?
Are you thinking about what to do at the festival?
------------------------------------------------
[00000011][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
He says he's been thinking about Panis forever.
It can't be helped.
------------------------------------------------
[00000012][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Instead of that, let's get ready for the festival!
It's a festival celebrating reconstruction, so you have to enjoy it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000013][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
There was a lot of miasma in that valley.
It just wasn't a situation where we could proceed as it was.
...Is there a time when the miasma fades?
------------------------------------------------
[00000014][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
It's a great festival,
You can't keep a blank face forever.
That's it! 
------------------------------------------------
[00000015][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
...What is it, Freed? That blank face.
------------------------------------------------
[00000016][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
Preparations for the festival are almost finished,
All that's left to do is wait for it to start.
------------------------------------------------
[00000017][シャノン,char_004 Shannon]
On the day, there will be various panis
I'm thinking of showing you.
I'm looking forward to it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000018][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
I won't lose either!
------------------------------------------------
[00000019][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It's like when you go fishing...
------------------------------------------------
[00000020][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Don't make too much noise and lose your way.
------------------------------------------------
[00000021][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
It's a festival! It's a festival, Freed!
It makes your blood boil, right?
I'll go wild too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000022][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Ou! Let's liven up the festival with you and me!
Woooooooo! My arms are ringing!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000023][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Isn't that obvious?
It's a festival! What should I do if I can't get excited?
Freed, let's make some noise together!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000024][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
...Hey, Freed.
I'm looking forward to what's to come,
Don't say anything that will put a damper on things.
------------------------------------------------
[00000025][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
...Hey, what's wrong with Freed?
Aren't you looking forward to the festival?
Look more happy!
------------------------------------------------
[00000026][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
What happened to me was
I was a little confused at the ruins...
I'm sorry.
------------------------------------------------
[00000027][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
No matter what, Panis is Panis.
------------------------------------------------
[00000028][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
There's no point in worrying about this and that.
Let's go fishing for fun!
We'll catch a lot of fish to serve at the festival!
------------------------------------------------
[00000029][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
A long time ago, a fish bigger than a boar pig,
I once caught a fish by myself.
It's my secret pride.
------------------------------------------------
[00000030][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Ha ha ha!
Look! That's a big catch!
I caught a ton of fish!
------------------------------------------------
[00000031][ジンガ,char_005 zynga]
Wait! These guys at the festival,
I'll feed you to the full!
------------------------------------------------
[00000032][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
We should have fun together.
------------------------------------------------
[00000033][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
You don't have to think about it too hard.
------------------------------------------------
[00000034][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Is there really nothing?
------------------------------------------------
[00000035][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
It's a festival, but I don't have any tricks.
I don't have the confidence to entertain everyone.
What should I do?
------------------------------------------------
[00000036][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
If you want to liven up the atmosphere by making noise together,
I think it might be helpful. I got it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000037][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Even if you say that, I still feel uneasy...
I got it.
Act based on your own judgment depending on the situation.
------------------------------------------------
[00000038][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
very sorry.
Something entertainment-related
The program is not implemented...
------------------------------------------------
[00000039][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
At least don't let the festival get messy.
Be very careful about your actions.
------------------------------------------------
[00000040][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Mr. Freed doesn't seem to have an answer either.
I'll think about it a little more myself.
------------------------------------------------
[00000041][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
These days, everyone in the village feels less stressed.
His mental state also seems to be very stable.
------------------------------------------------
[00000042][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
However, from Mr. Freed and others,
I feel unstable. I wonder why……?
------------------------------------------------
[00000043][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
I tried to measure the toxicity of the miasma in that valley.
The concentration of harmful ingredients was too high.
------------------------------------------------
[00000044][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Unfortunately, my measuring equipment is better.
It almost broke...
------------------------------------------------
[00000045][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
On the other side of the valley, even for me, a machine,
It was hotter than the normal temperature.
If you stay too long, you may run out of heat.
------------------------------------------------
[00000046][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Seeing everyone in the village lively,
I feel like my operating efficiency will also increase.
I would also like to cooperate with the festival.
------------------------------------------------
[00000047][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Mr. Freed,
I would like to make a dish using vegetables grown on the farm.
Could you please help me?
------------------------------------------------
[00000048][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
The excitement of everyone in the village is at its max.
Is it influenced by your mental state?
My body also seems to be getting hot.
------------------------------------------------
[00000049][アダム,char_006 a-dam]
Mr. Freed,
Has the festival not started yet?
------------------------------------------------
[00000050][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I'll be expecting!
------------------------------------------------
[00000051][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Do your best.
------------------------------------------------
[00000052][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Even if you don't worry too much...
------------------------------------------------
[00000053][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
The village is becoming more and more lively due to the festival.
------------------------------------------------
[00000054][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
When this happens, I too
I have to prepare at least one performance...
------------------------------------------------
[00000055][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Wow, that's a lot of pressure all of a sudden...
------------------------------------------------
[00000056][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
However, since it was expected,
Justice is the answer!
Please look forward to!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000057][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
yes! We will do our best to prepare for the festival!
Let's all have a fun festival!
------------------------------------------------
[00000058][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
is that so? I felt like there were a lot of expectations...
Maybe I was too self-conscious.
------------------------------------------------
[00000059][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
...Um, don't you need any performances?
...It doesn't seem necessary.
------------------------------------------------
[00000060][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Is it a festival?
By then, no matter what,
We will show you the results of the ruins investigation!
------------------------------------------------
[00000061][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
I'll do it! I!
------------------------------------------------
[00000062][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
It feels like it's finally here!
In order to enjoy the festival to the fullest,
We have to solve the mystery of Mr. Panis and this island quickly!
------------------------------------------------
[00000063][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
Deliver the results of the survey before the festival
I said that...
I'm sorry... it wasn't possible...
------------------------------------------------
[00000064][キルマリア,char_007 Kilmaria]
but! This festival celebrates the restoration of your village!
So let's enjoy this place to the fullest!
------------------------------------------------
[00000065][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It's about finding "power", right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000066][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Enjoying the festival, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000067][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Getting good at naval battles, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000068][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
The village is in a festive mood.
But what you should do,
You haven't forgotten, have you?
------------------------------------------------
[00000069][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
that's right!
Anyway, I remember it properly. I felt relieved.
------------------------------------------------
[00000070][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
You're still making fun of this, Freed!
I asked for it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000071][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
It's completely different though...
Well, to put a damper on this situation,
I'm not uncouth either.
------------------------------------------------
[00000072][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Let's enjoy this festival!
I'll have fun with you, so please join me!
------------------------------------------------
[00000073][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Look, I forgot!
Isn't that just for your convenience?
------------------------------------------------
[00000074][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Information about my reward and the "power" I'm looking for.
O-wa-su-re-na-ku!
------------------------------------------------
[00000075][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
...You've forgotten. That's enough.
------------------------------------------------
[00000076][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Freed, don't look so gloomy.
Don't think too deeply about Panis, okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000077][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
If that's the case, I...
Can you make me forget? Ufufufufu♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000078][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Valley of miasma...
If only I could do something about that miasma...
------------------------------------------------
[00000079][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Hmm...
In a little while,
I think I can think of something...
------------------------------------------------
[00000080][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
That's too bad, Freed.
Could you please come again at night?
------------------------------------------------
[00000081][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
I love festivals!
I'm excited and looking forward to it now!
------------------------------------------------
[00000082][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
……picture? Because I specialize in eating and drinking,
There's no need to prepare♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000083][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Now, it's finally the festival!
We have to eat, drink and make a lot of noise!
Of course, you can also conquer all the stalls!
------------------------------------------------
[00000084][ベルベット,char_008 Velvet]
Ah, I can't wait to start!
------------------------------------------------
[00000085][ガルゼー,char_501]
I think festivals and reconstruction are somewhat similar.
Yes, each one of us should do what we can,
There are scenes where everyone is trying to liven up the village.
------------------------------------------------
[00000086][ガルゼー,char_501]
In this way, everyone's feelings become one,
It's more important than anything.
------------------------------------------------
[00000087][ガルゼー,char_501]
However, it's been a while since the festival lasted.
When was the last time you did it...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000088][ガルゼー,char_501]
Anyway, the only thing is that it was a great deal of excitement.
I remember it well.
------------------------------------------------
[00000089][ジム,char_502]
I'm looking forward to it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000090][ジム,char_502]
What are you doing?
------------------------------------------------
[00000091][ジム,char_502]
What do you do to stand out?
------------------------------------------------
[00000092][ジム,char_502]
Hehehehe...is it a festival...?
Look, Freed!
I'll definitely stand out more than you at the festival!
------------------------------------------------
[00000093][ジム,char_502]
You are not the star of the festival!
I'm Jim-sama!
------------------------------------------------
[00000094][ジム,char_502]
……picture?
Well, it's gone. I didn't expect to be looked forward to it.
Ha, it seems like the hurdle has been raised...
------------------------------------------------
[00000095][ジム,char_502]
Damn it!
I'll show you something that will amaze you!
I'm looking forward to it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000096][ジム,char_502]
That's...um...
Well, I guess...I can't do hidden tricks...
There's nothing, I...
------------------------------------------------
[00000097][ジム,char_502]
Anyway, it stands out!
I'll think about the method later!
------------------------------------------------
[00000098][ジム,char_502]
picture……?
Oh, how noisy! For you,
You don't know how I feel!
------------------------------------------------
[00000099][ジム,char_502]
What are those eyes?
Don't look at me like I'm sorry!
------------------------------------------------
[00000100][ジム,char_502]
It's been a long time since we've had a festival!
I can't help but get excited!
------------------------------------------------
[00000101][ジム,char_502]
Which store do you go to for Freed?
...Is it me?
For me, of course, it's the grilled fish stall!
------------------------------------------------
[00000102][ジム,char_502]
Eat the fish that Zinga's brother caught,
I need to be strong like my big brother!
------------------------------------------------
[00000103][マイア,char_503]
Festivals are something everyone prepares for.
I will also be cooking together with the students.
------------------------------------------------
[00000104][マイア,char_503]
But those kids,
It would be nice if you could help me, but...
I don't often eat snacks...
------------------------------------------------
[00000105][マイア,char_503]
Hehehe, about the time of festivals.
I'll also let you untie me.
It's a celebration of reconstruction, so it's a little bit nice, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000106][マイア,char_503]
drunk in front of children
I was saying something strange,
Please follow me, Freed-kun.
------------------------------------------------
[00000107][アリーゼ,char_504]
Unusually, my father...
Don't even say the word "bo" for adventure.
I'm working hard at the shop!
------------------------------------------------
[00000108][アリーゼ,char_504]
Now...
The alcohol that everyone drinks at festivals.
They are procuring it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000109][アリーゼ,char_504]
I have prepared plenty of food and drinks!
But please wait until the festival starts!
------------------------------------------------
[00000110][アリーゼ,char_504]
Hehe, I get excited when the festival is near.
My father helps out at the store.
I'm always happy if it's like this!
------------------------------------------------
[00000111][ダイアナ,char_505]
I have to prepare for the festival too...
I'll prepare a special item...
Cursed items or something...hehehe...
------------------------------------------------
[00000112][ダイアナ,char_505]
Freed...I also prepared a cute one...
What if I bought it for Panis...?
Should I mark it as sold...? Hehehehehe...♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000113][ドルトン,char_506]
I only make weapons.
This is a policy and cannot be compromised.
So, I'm thinking of making a weapon for the festival.
------------------------------------------------
[00000114][ドルトン,char_506]
...By the way, Freed?
What do you think about festival weapons?
------------------------------------------------
[00000115][ドルトン,char_506]
Oh, Freed.
The festival weapon is complete.
------------------------------------------------
[00000116][ドルトン,char_506]
...I'm sorry, but I can't sell it to you guys.
This is for people who don't usually use weapons.
It was trained to get used to it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000117][ドルトン,char_506]
You guys should buy some normal weapons.
------------------------------------------------
[00000118][ロラン,char_507]
I'm looking forward to the festival!
There's going to be a lot of shops, right?
I'm confused about where to go now!
------------------------------------------------
[00000119][ロラン,char_507]
I go to all the stores on festival days!
I don't know how many there are, but I'll do my best!
------------------------------------------------
[00000120][カール,char_508]
Let's all have fun together!
------------------------------------------------
[00000121][カール,char_508]
I'll help you out as well.
------------------------------------------------
[00000122][カール,char_508]
Don't eat too much.
------------------------------------------------
[00000123][カール,char_508]
I'm looking forward to the festival!
I play a lot,
You can even eat a feast...
------------------------------------------------
[00000124][カール,char_508]
Yeah! I'll teach you all sorts of things!
------------------------------------------------
[00000125][カール,char_508]
Yeah!
We're also doing singing lessons, so please look forward to it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000126][カール,char_508]
I-I know...
------------------------------------------------
[00000127][カール,char_508]
When I was thinking about the festival,
I'm hungry...
------------------------------------------------
[00000128][カール,char_508]
On festival days, sweet shops are open.
There will be a lot!
I really like fish-shaped sweets!
------------------------------------------------
[00000129][カール,char_508]
The festival will start soon!
I'm so excited, what should I do?
I don't know which store to go to!
------------------------------------------------
[00000130][メリー,char_509]
I'm going to participate in the Nodojiman competition at the festival!
...Will there be panis as well?
If he does appear, he'll be a serious rival...
------------------------------------------------
[00000131][メリー,char_509]
The decoration is so beautiful!
It doesn't seem like the usual plaza!
The festival is finally starting!
------------------------------------------------
[00000132][ハンス,char_510]
On the day of the festival, we'll have so much alcohol that you won't be able to drink it all!
prepared for this day,
We'll even open some special sake for you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000133][ハンス,char_510]
Well, the festival is about to begin!
Drink, drink, drink!
Wow, I'm just as excited as the adventure!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000134][ボリス,char_511]
By the time the festival was held, the village had recovered...
This is all thanks to you guys.
Thank you so much.
------------------------------------------------
[00000135][ボリス,char_511]
Once in a while, forget about the battle and enjoy the festival.
------------------------------------------------
[00000136][ボリス,char_511]
It's an auspicious festival to celebrate reconstruction!
I think I'll try dancing for the first time in a while!
------------------------------------------------
[00000137][ボリス,char_511]
...Waist?
It's so great to forget about lower back pain!
------------------------------------------------
[00000138][デボラ,char_512]
Thanks to the guardian deities and you,
The village has been successfully rebuilt.
Well done, thank you for your hard work.
------------------------------------------------
[00000139][デボラ,char_512]
Please enjoy the festival day.
------------------------------------------------
[00000140][デボラ,char_512]
Festivals are great, aren't they?
When I was young,
We used to go around the shops together...
------------------------------------------------
[00000141][デボラ,char_512]
……picture? Ufufufu, no, this kid!
------------------------------------------------
[00000142][ハイラム,char_513]
The decorations for this festival will be extravagant!
Flashy decorations will make you feel more excited!
Please look forward to it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000143][ハイラム,char_513]
Now, the festival decorations are ready!
Pretty good, right?
Now we just have to wait for the actual performance! I'm looking forward to it!!
------------------------------------------------
[00000144][リアン,char_514]
But, Auntie, you love festivals, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000145][リアン,char_514]
It seems really difficult.
------------------------------------------------
[00000146][リアン,char_514]
Shall I do it instead?
------------------------------------------------
[00000147][リアン,char_514]
As the festival approaches, there are so many things to do.
I also want to help decorate the square,
I also have to bake a lot of bread...
------------------------------------------------
[00000148][リアン,char_514]
Of course!
As the festival approaches, I'm already excited,
I can't sit still!
------------------------------------------------
[00000149][リアン,char_514]
Hehehe, that's why this busyness is a happy busyness!
------------------------------------------------
[00000150][リアン,char_514]
You are right!
But this busyness is also part of the fun of the festival.
------------------------------------------------
[00000151][リアン,char_514]
What are you talking about?
This busyness is also part of the fun of the festival!
Please don't take that away from me!
------------------------------------------------
[00000152][リアン,char_514]
...There's no point in trying to run away, Freed.
I'll make sure to help you, okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000153][リアン,char_514]
Oh, Freed.
We also need to prepare bread for the festival.
I'll do my best and make a lot!
------------------------------------------------
[00000154][リアン,char_514]
Oh, Freed!
Thanks to you, we have bread for the festival too.
I've prepared a lot! thank you!
------------------------------------------------
[00000155][リアン,char_514]
...So, Shannon...
"I'll make a new one for the festival too!"
I'm so excited...
------------------------------------------------
[00000156][リアン,char_514]
If you notice it, please stop me, okay?
Did you ask for it?
------------------------------------------------
[00000157][ダリオ,char_515]
Even in the middle of a festival, don't let your guard down.
As always, keep watch.
That's us, the vigilante group!
------------------------------------------------
[00000158][ダリオ,char_515]
My job as a watchman is as usual...
It's a celebration of the village's recovery,
Can I have a little drink?
------------------------------------------------
[00000159][ミルコ,char_516]
When you're making noise at a festival,
I have to stay on guard and keep a close watch.
------------------------------------------------
[00000160][ミルコ,char_516]
The festival is finally here...
Lana and Velvet are
Will they be dancing at the festival?
------------------------------------------------
[00000161][ミルコ,char_516]
The sight of two people dancing beautifully,
I want to see it with my own eyes...
------------------------------------------------
[00000162][ロドリゴ,char_517]
During festivals, fireworks are launched from here.
It's beautiful, so don't miss it!
------------------------------------------------
[00000163][ロドリゴ,char_517]
...If you use that cannon,
Huge fireworks will be set off.
Would you like to think about it...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000164][ロドリゴ,char_517]
The fireworks are ready!
I'm going to launch something extra large and flashy!
------------------------------------------------
[00000165][ロドリゴ,char_517]
Ah, I can't wait to light the fuse!
------------------------------------------------
[00000166][ダニエル,char_518]
I'm planning to serve special cheese on festival days.
This is a work that Peter and I are proud of and have put a lot of effort into creating.
It's amazingly delicious!
------------------------------------------------
[00000167][ダニエル,char_518]
Even so, it was a big wild pig.
With that, everyone in the village should be able to eat it.
That was helpful, thank you.
------------------------------------------------
[00000168][ダニエル,char_518]
I was thinking of entering the Nodojiman competition, but
For some reason, Peter doesn't like it...
Maybe it's better not to participate...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000169][ブレンダ,char_519]
I'm also looking forward to Brenda's skewers.
------------------------------------------------
[00000170][ブレンダ,char_519]
Aunt Leanne was so excited.
------------------------------------------------
[00000171][ブレンダ,char_519]
It's not that different from regular bread, right?
------------------------------------------------
[00000172][ブレンダ,char_519]
Lian just came to buy milk.
Do you bake a lot of bread for the festival?
It's fun.
------------------------------------------------
[00000173][ブレンダ,char_519]
After all, when it comes to festivals,
I have to make that.
Everyone seems to be looking forward to it.
------------------------------------------------
[00000174][ブレンダ,char_519]
Ufufu, because everyone in the village
Are you waiting for Lian's bread?
I have to get myself fired up.
------------------------------------------------
[00000175][ブレンダ,char_519]
That's not true!
There's always something a little different about festival bread.
I wonder if they use a special powder...
------------------------------------------------
[00000176][ブレンダ,char_519]
what happened? Did the thought of bread make you hungry?
------------------------------------------------
[00000177][ブレンダ,char_519]
At festivals, ``sheep sables'' shaped like sheep are served.
I'll treat everyone to a feast.
This is Daniel's favorite food.
------------------------------------------------
[00000178][ブレンダ,char_519]
Enjoying the festival together as a family
I'm very grateful.
------------------------------------------------
[00000179][ブレンダ,char_519]
But it's about time for Peter.
Even if you find a wonderful person to go to a festival with,
I guess it's okay...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000180][ピーター,char_520]
I was in charge of the Nodojiman Tournament.
Because this is an important job requested by the village chief,
I have to try hard.
------------------------------------------------
[00000181][ピーター,char_520]
However, you will have less time to look around the festival,
I guess it's just a little disappointing...
------------------------------------------------
[00000182][ピーター,char_520]
My father wants to participate in the Nodojiman Contest.
As a person in charge, it would be better if there were more participants...
------------------------------------------------
[00000183][ピーター,char_520]
But when I met my father at such a place,
It's really embarrassing, isn't it...?
------------------------------------------------
[00000184][ラナ,char_528]
Oh, I'll go look around with Panis...
------------------------------------------------
[00000185][ラナ,char_528]
Yeah, let's all take a look.
------------------------------------------------
[00000186][ラナ,char_528]
picture? 
------------------------------------------------
[00000187][ラナ,char_528]
Hey, are you having a festival?
Freed, let's take a look around together, okay?
------------------------------------------------
[00000188][ラナ,char_528]
Ahahahaha!
Why are you blushing, Freed!
------------------------------------------------
[00000189][ラナ,char_528]
Just kidding, Joe!
I'm planning on doing business at the festival.
Freed gets along well with Panis♪
------------------------------------------------
[00000190][ラナ,char_528]
Oh, I'm with Freed.
It would have been better if it was just the two of us...
------------------------------------------------
[00000191][ラナ,char_528]
Oh, I'm just kidding, Joe!
I'm planning to open a stall, so
Everyone come and have fun!
------------------------------------------------
[00000192][ラナ,char_528]
Eh, what is that!
I want to participate in the festival too!
------------------------------------------------
[00000193][ラナ,char_528]
...Why are you silent?
Maybe it would be a nuisance if I went?
------------------------------------------------
[00000194][ラナ,char_528]
Is it a festival? Looks like fun!
The people in the village seem excited too.
Maybe I should open a shop too!?
------------------------------------------------
[00000195][ラナ,char_528]
I just took a look at the plaza!
Don't you feel like you're all ready for the festival?
I got excited too!
------------------------------------------------
