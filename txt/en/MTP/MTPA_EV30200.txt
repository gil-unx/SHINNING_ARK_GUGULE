Freed-kun.
I want to resume classes soon.
Could you help me fix the school?
------------------------------------------------

The school bell is for everyone in the village.
It also serves to tell the time, right?
In that sense, I need to fix it as soon as possible.

Of course, sir!
What can I help you with?
------------------------------------------------
[00000003][マイア,char_503]
I'll ask everyone else to fix it,
Could you guys please collect the materials?
------------------------------------------------
[00000004][フリード,char_001 Fried]
Okay, I'll go right away!
------------------------------------------------
[00000005][マイア,char_503]
Thank you, thanks to everyone
School is fixed.
------------------------------------------------
[00000006][マイア,char_503]
Thanks to you, it looks like classes will resume soon.
The kids are happy too.

Freed-kun and Shannon-chan too,
There's still a lot to learn, right?
So why don't you come to school sometimes?

Are you always welcome? Hehehehe.
